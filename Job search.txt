Dear [Hiring Manager’s Name],

I am excited to apply for the [Job Title] role at [Company Name]. With hands-on experience coordinating multiple AI tools and designing workflows that improve reliability, I bring a practical skill set well-suited for AI operations and product support. My background includes documenting complex processes, authoring schemas, and ensuring reproducibility across systems like GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot.

In addition to my AI research work, I have a strong record of precision and accountability in prior roles, from building custom cabinetry to managing broadcast schedules under tight deadlines. These experiences taught me how to adapt quickly, communicate clearly, and maintain accuracy in high-pressure environments—qualities I now apply directly to AI systems work.

I would welcome the chance to contribute these skills to your team, ensuring your AI workflows are well-supported, documented, and continuously improving. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support [Company Name]’s goals.

Sincerely,  
Joshua Vetos  
Sioux Falls, SD • (712) 389-2227 • jsvetos90@gmail.com

15–20 Second Pitch

“I focus on AI operations and workflow support. Over the past couple years I’ve coordinated tools like GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot, and built processes that turn system errors into reliable updates. My strength is documentation and structure—taking complex AI work and making it reproducible and easy to understand. Before this, I worked in precision cabinetry and broadcast scheduling, so I’m used to accuracy, deadlines, and high standards. I’d love to bring that mix of adaptability and structure to your team.”

About / Summary
I focus on making AI systems reliable, usable, and accountable. Over the past two years I’ve coordinated multiple AI tools (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot), designing workflows that turn system errors into corrective updates and building structured logs for reproducibility.

My background combines technical documentation with hands-on precision—whether it was building custom cabinetry to exact specs or managing broadcast schedules under deadline pressure. What ties it together is adaptability, attention to detail, and clear communication.

I’m especially interested in roles where I can support AI operations, product testing, or governance—helping teams move faster without losing reliability.

# Job Sweep Protocol v1

## Purpose
A repeatable, AI-native workflow for discovering, ranking, tuning, and drafting applications for AI operations, product support, QA, documentation, and governance roles. Built to leverage multi-agent orchestration at scale.

---

## Workflow Chain

### Step 1 – Perplexity (Intake & Structure)
**Prompt:**  
"Find 50 fresh postings (last 30 days) in AI operations, product support, QA, documentation, and governance. For each, return: Job Title, Company, Location, Short Description, Application Link, Posted Date. Output as a JSON array of 50 objects. No summary outside JSON."

**Output:**  
JSON array of 50 job objects.

---

### Step 2 – Gemini (Ranking & Matching)
**Input:**  
Perplexity’s JSON output.

**Prompt:**  
"Rank all 50 jobs by alignment with my résumé profile (workflow design, documentation, reproducibility, system coordination). For the top 10, provide: (a) one-sentence 'why fit', (b) recommended résumé variant (Ops or Doc). Output: ranked 1–50 list, top 10 expanded."

**Output:**  
Ranked list 1–50 with résumé mapping for top 10.

---

### Step 3 – Copilot (ATS Optimization)
**Input:**  
Gemini’s top 10 list with résumé variants.

**Prompt:**  
"For each role: (1) Extract 5–10 ATS keywords, (2) confirm résumé variant, (3) suggest ≤3 résumé bullet rewrites integrating those keywords. Output as structured list: Keywords | Résumé Variant | Suggested Edits."

**Output:**  
Keyword map + bullet rewrites per role.

---

### Step 4 – Claude (Cover Letters)
**Input:**  
Top 10 jobs with résumé variant (from Gemini) + keyword emphasis (from Copilot).

**Prompt:**  
"Write 10 cover letter blurbs (120–150 words each): recruiter-friendly, role-specific, naturally weaving in ATS keywords. Structure: enthusiasm + role/company reference → link résumé strengths → close with availability. Output: 10 blurbs, labeled by role."

**Output:**  
10 recruiter-ready cover letters.

---

## Receipts Layer
- **Raw Sweep Folder:** Save Perplexity JSON intact.  
- **Ranking Folder:** Store Gemini outputs (ranked list + résumé variant map).  
- **ATS Folder:** Save Copilot’s keyword/bullet maps.  
- **Letters Folder:** Store Claude’s blurbs in a searchable bank.  
- **Tracker (Sheet/Notion):** Columns for Job, Company, Date, Résumé Variant, ATS Bullets, Cover Letter, Status.

---

## Operational Notes
- Run weekly sweeps to maintain fresh opportunities.  
- Build 2 modular résumé cores (Ops + Doc), with Copilot bullets slotted per application.  
- Reuse Claude blurbs as templates—lightly tweak company/product mentions.  
- Measure agent performance (success/fail) each cycle to map limits and reliability.  

---

## Standing Contradiction Anchor
**Challenge Principle:** Prompts must target tasks difficult for GPT alone (wide sweeps, large-scale parsing, ATS keyword mining, batch cover letter drafting). If agents succeed, it’s leverage. If they fail, the failure itself is data.
