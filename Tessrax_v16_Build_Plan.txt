Directive — Tessrax v16 Build Plan (Audited & Expanded Edition)
Filename: Tessrax_v16_Build_Plan.txt
Purpose: Blueprint for the next major Tessrax release (v16.0 → v16.5) incorporating full governance, risk, and documentation standards.
Scope: Implements field validation, federation, epistemic metrics, pedagogy, incentive economy, and contradiction-energy modeling—aligned with formal Software Development Plan (SDP) best practices [3-5].

⸻

I. Field Validation Layer (v16.0)

Goal: Connect Tessrax metabolism to live, falsifiable data.
Datasets: Climate TRACE, Data.gov, Corporate ESG, Fake Claim, ManConCorpus.
Module: tessrax/data_ingest/normalize_external.py
Directive:

python tessrax/data_ingest/normalize_external.py --source climate_trace

Output Schema: {subject, metric, value, timestamp, source, context}
Verification: Cross-validate claims against ledger history.
Metric Target: Integrity ≥ 0.90, Drift ≤ 0.05.

⸻

II. Federated Governance Layer (v16.1)

Goal: Enable multi-node truth consensus.
Consensus Protocol: Tendermint (BFT safety, instant finality).
Modules:
   •   tessrax/federation/consensus.py — receipt broadcast & quorum
   •   tessrax/federation/config.yaml — node IDs and slices
Testing:

pytest tests/test_federated_consensus.py

Performance Targets: ≤ 500 ms latency, ≤ 1/3 Byzantine fault tolerance, deterministic finality.

⸻

III. Epistemic Metrics Expansion (v16.2)

Goal: Quantify knowledge instability via information-theoretic metrics.
Metrics: Entropy (Shannon), Drift (Bayesian Surprise), Integrity/Severity (Free-Energy fit).
File: tessrax/metrics/epistemic_health.py
Formula Additions:

def bayesian_surprise(prior, posterior):
    return np.sum(posterior * np.log(posterior / prior))

def free_energy(expected, observed, T=1.0):
    entropy = -np.sum(observed * np.log(observed))
    E = 0.5 * np.linalg.norm(expected - observed)**2
    return E - T * entropy

Output: epistemic_metrics.jsonl → ledger receipts.

⸻

IV. Dashboard Literacy Layer (v16.3)

Goal: Make epistemic processes intuitive to non-technical users.
Framework: Streamlit + D3.js
Components: contradiction_timeline.py, clarity_flow.py, surprise_heatmap.py.
Pedagogical Inspiration: Data journalism and AI-explainability design.
Interaction Goals: time-slider for contradictions, animated repair cycle, evidence anchors linked to receipts.

⸻

V. Incentive & Legal Layer (v16.4)

Goal: Create sustainable reward mechanisms for verified truth discovery.
Model: “Truth Credit” economy inspired by bug-bounties and prediction markets.
Modules: tessrax/economy/truth_credit.py, tessrax/economy/arbitration.py.
Mechanics: Contradiction → LedgerReceipt → mint credit token; reward = severity × impact × consensus weight.
Governance: Slashing for false claims; federated arbitration audits.
Adoption Targets: Media trust dashboards, academic reproducibility audits, regulatory compliance trials.

⸻

VI. Contradiction Energy Formalism (v16.5)

Goal: Treat contradictions as quantifiable energy states.
E = \tfrac{1}{2}\kappa\|\Delta\|^2,\qquad \Delta=\text{observed}-\text{expected}
Integration: tessrax/metabolism/reconcile.py computes energy per event.
Dashboard: “Epistemic Thermograph” showing energy decay over reconciliation cycles.
Metrics: Energy Dissipation Rate and Entropy-Stability correlation ( R² ≥ 0.8 ).

⸻

VII. Verification & Audit Hooks

CI Workflow: .github/workflows/verify_v16.yml
Ledger Proofs: All metrics signed to ledger/receipts/v16/.
Targets: Integrity ≥ 0.96, Drift ≤ 0.02, Severity ≤ 0.03.
Safepoint: SAFEPOINT_V16_INIT_READY.

⸻

VIII. Risk & Dependency Management (New)

Risks: data quality variance, node downtime, adversarial inputs, library drift.
Dependencies: FastAPI ≥ 0.120, Python 3.11 lock set, Redis/Celery queue, Tendermint daemon.
Mitigation: lock-file enforcement (Sync Guard), redundant nodes, dataset checksums, adversarial budget caps.

⸻

IX. Stakeholder Roles & Responsibilities (New)

| Role | Primary Duties | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Module Owner | Implements assigned sub-module (v16.x) | Code + unit tests + ledger receipts |
| Governance Lead | Approves safepoints and audits | Signed audit report |
| Community Manager | Coordinates external contributors | Issue tracking + documentation |
| Verification Auditor | Runs CI and verifies hashes | Integrity ledger entries |

⸻

X. Versioning & Migration Strategy (New)
   •   Ledger schema migration script tessrax/tools/migrate_v15_to_v16.py.
   •   Backward compatibility maintained through schema adapter until v16.5.
   •   User transition plan: dashboard notification → auto-import legacy receipts.

⸻

XI. Documentation & Training Commitment (New)
   •   Update API docs and user guides (docs/v16/).
   •   Provide interactive dashboard demo and tutorial videos.
   •   Publish developer onboarding checklist for external contributors.
   •   Host quarterly governance training session to maintain audit literacy.

⸻

XII. Quality and Audit Summary

This plan meets recognized software development plan standards (SDP, ISO/IEC 12207). It delivers:
   •   Clarity of Purpose: explicit goals per phase.
   •   Modular Structure: phased v16.x delivery.
   •   Implementation Precision: commands, metrics, and schemas.
   •   Human Focus: pedagogical dashboards and incentive models.
   •   Verification Discipline: CI + cryptographic ledger proofs.
   •   Theoretical Innovation: contradiction energy as computable epistemic force.
