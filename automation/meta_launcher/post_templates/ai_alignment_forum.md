## Title
Introducing Tessrax: Experimental Governance for Contradiction Metabolism

## Body
Tessrax operationalizes the idea that institutional contradictions can be metabolized into stable policies. It encodes governance feedback into contradiction resolution chains and formalizes epistemic healing across agent collectives.

Highlights:
- Uses clarity receipts to track reconciliation progress
- Embeds contradiction audits into a verifiable governance ledger
- Implements a metabolism model balancing contradiction density and decision integrity

Seeking collaborators interested in AI personhood, ethical audit design, and contradiction epistemics.
