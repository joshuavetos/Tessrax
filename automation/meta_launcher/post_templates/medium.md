## Title
Tessrax: A Self-Auditing Framework for Algorithmic Governance

## Body
In algorithmic systems, transparency alone isn’t enough — governance must metabolize contradiction. Tessrax implements a full-stack architecture that audits, logs, and reconciles divergent agent statements into structured clarity.

Explore how:
- Contradictions become feedback artifacts
- Reconciliation maps tension to consensus
- Ledgers create verifiable moral provenance for AI decisions
