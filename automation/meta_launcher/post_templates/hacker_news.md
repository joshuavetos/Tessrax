Show HN: Tessrax â€“ Open Governance Engine for AI Contradictions

## Body
Tessrax is a research-grade framework for transforming contradictions in multi-agent systems into verifiable governance actions. It merges audit-ledger logic with adaptive reconciliation methods to stabilize AI decision loops.

Features:
- ContradictionEngine for structured claim analysis
- Hash-chained Ledger for immutable audit tracking
- ReconciliationEngine translating contradictions into clarity statements
- Streamlit dashboards for live audits and agent feedback
- FastAPI governance API for model submission and review

Repo: [github.com/joshuavetos/Tessrax]

Discussion welcome around ledger design, agent audit loops, and governance inference speed tradeoffs.
