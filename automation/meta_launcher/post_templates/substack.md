## Title
Reimagining Institutional Logic: Tessrax and the Epistemic Metabolism of AI

## Body
Tessrax offers a new perspective on AI governance—one that doesn’t censor contradiction but metabolizes it. By leveraging contradiction detection and verifiable reconciliation, the framework turns disagreement into institutional learning.

Key Concepts:
- Contradiction density as governance signal
- Hash-chained clarity receipts for epistemic traceability
- Metabolic governance kernel translating disputes into coherence
