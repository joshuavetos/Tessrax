## Title
Tessrax: A Framework for Contradiction Metabolism in AI Governance

## Body
We've released Tessrax, a Python-based framework simulating epistemic metabolism in AI governance systems. The toolset models how governance engines detect, evaluate, and reconcile contradictions among autonomous agents using audited ledgers.

Core modules:
- `ContradictionEngine`: identifies conflicting claims within distributed inputs
- `GovernanceKernel`: applies formal logic protocols to contradictions
- `MetabolicReconciliation`: converts contradictions into clarity receipts stored on-chain
- `Tessrax Ledger`: immutable audit ledger using hash chaining

We’re particularly interested in feedback on the reconciliation heuristics (consensus weighting, tolerance thresholds) and potential integrations with agent-based simulation pipelines (Mesa, RePast, or custom RL agents).
