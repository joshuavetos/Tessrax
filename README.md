# Tessrax v1.0 — Contradiction Metabolism Engine

Tessrax is an **AI governance framework** designed to metabolize contradictions.  
It transforms conflicting signals (“scars”) into structured, auditable artifacts on an immutable ledger.

## ✨ Core Purpose
Tessrax is a governance agent that:
- Detects contradictions in data, policy, or behavior.  
- Records them as **Scars** with provenance.  
- Resolves them through structured governance engines.  
- Anchors receipts and ledger states for external audit.
