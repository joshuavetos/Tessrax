Tessrax v13.5 — Quantitative Governance & Contradiction Metabolism Framework

A self-auditing architecture that transforms systemic conflict into verified knowledge.

⸻

1. Overview

Tessrax is a formally verified governance framework that learns through the resolution of its own contradictions.

Where traditional systems suppress inconsistencies, Tessrax thrives on them.
Every contradiction—between datasets, policies, or agents—is detected, metabolized, and recorded as a cryptographically verifiable event.
Each conflict becomes a Scar, each resolution a Receipt, together forming a complete, auditable history of the system’s reasoning and evolution.

The framework operates wherever trust, adaptability, and accountability must coexist—AI governance, compliance automation, institutional decision systems, or autonomous infrastructure.

2. Governance Philosophy

2.1 Contradiction as Metabolic Fuel

Contradictions are not bugs—they are energy sources. Tessrax treats every inconsistency as valuable information about a misalignment or outdated assumption.
This “contradiction metabolism” transforms informational tension into systemic learning and self-correction.

2.2 Clarity Fuel Economy

Each successfully resolved contradiction generates Clarity Fuel, a quantifiable non-monetary resource defined as
fuel = 12 × (detachment_score ^ 1.5).
Clarity Fuel powers governance actions, influences quorum votes, and rewards agents (human or machine) who reduce systemic uncertainty.

2.3 Epistemic Hygiene

To prevent epistemic drift—the gradual decay of model integrity—the system tracks metrics like contradiction_score and completeness_score.
If contradictions exceed 0.75 or completeness falls below 0.6, an Epistemic Reset cold-starts the reasoning stack from a verified baseline.
This ensures continual renewal of truth models.

2.4 Proof Over Trust

Every action—analysis, resolution, reset—is cryptographically signed, hash-linked, and permanently recorded on the Immutable Ledger.
Nothing in Tessrax requires blind trust; every decision is reproducible and verifiable by design.

3. System Architecture

Tessrax follows a modular, event-driven architecture built for auditable reasoning.

[Unstructured Input] 
   ↓
[Claim Extractor] 
   ↓
[Contradiction Engine]
   ↓
[Governance Kernel]
   ↓
[Immutable Ledger]
   ↓
[Audit Visualizer]

Each component performs a distinct metabolic role:

Component	Function
Claim Extractor	Parses unstructured text into structured numeric or declarative claims.
Contradiction Engine	Detects numeric, temporal, and normative conflicts via transformer NLI + symbolic logic.
Governance Kernel	Applies policy rules, determines severity, triggers resets or escalation.
Immutable Ledger	Hash-chained, Ed25519-signed log providing full event provenance.
Audit Visualizer	Converts ledger and claim data into accessible JSON summaries and node-link diagrams.

4. How Tessrax Thinks

4.1 Judgment Learning Loop

The system evaluates its own reasoning. It compares predicted vs. observed outcomes, computes epistemic error, and updates internal thresholds—deciding when to reset, refine, or continue.
This process yields machine-level prudence: adaptive judgment that grows over time.

4.2 Contradiction Lifecycle
	1.	Ingest: Extract claims from raw text.
	2.	Detect: Compare targets vs. actuals; run NLI + symbolic analysis.
	3.	Govern: Evaluate contradiction via quorum policy rules.
	4.	Verify: Hash-chain decision and signature to ledger.
	5.	Audit: Visualize reasoning path for human inspection.

Each loop converts informational entropy into measurable clarity.

5. Cryptographic Ledger: Immutable Memory

Every governance event is recorded as a JSON entry containing:

{
  "event_type": "CONTRADICTION_ANALYSIS",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T13:10:00Z",
  "data": {"module": "ContradictionEngineV14", "type": "numeric", "score": 0.95},
  "prev_hash": "bf5a3e4cd9e9...",
  "hash": "fae2d0485f1c...",
  "signature": "ed25519:4aa3..."
}

Integrity guarantees:
   •   Hash chaining prevents silent alteration.
   •   Digital signatures verify module origin and authenticity.
   •   Merkle batching enables scalable proof checks.
   •   Timestamp anchoring links the Merkle root to public blockchains for global verifiability.

Ledger verification (verify_chain()) recomputes all hashes to confirm continuity—any divergence is instantly detectable.

6. Formal Verification Layer

Tessrax v13.5 introduces mathematical guarantees using TLA⁺, Coq, and Alloy proofs to enforce invariants:

ID	Invariant	Guarantee
L1	Hash-Chain Integrity	Every ledger entry cryptographically linked
L2	Signature Validity	All receipts verifiably signed
G1	Weighted Quorum	Governance actions meet 80 % agreement
G2	Reset Safety	Epistemic resets never orphan receipts
G3	Contradiction Closure	Every Scar resolves into a Receipt
T1	Fork Resistance	No divergent ledger indices
T2	Drift Detection	System resets on epistemic instability > 0.75

7. Example: The Journey of a Claim

Step	Module	Action
1	Claim Extractor	“Tesla pledged 25 % reduction by 2030.” → structured JSON target
2	Contradiction Detector	Finds 7 % deviation from actual 18 % → flags numeric contradiction
3	Governance Kernel	Applies environmental policy thresholds → outcome: REJECTED
4	Ledger	Logs decision with hash + signature
5	Visualizer	Renders claim → contradiction → decision graph for audit

Each claim’s story becomes a verifiable chain of reasoning—proof, not narrative.

8. Quick Start

# 1. Launch system
docker compose up -d --build

# 2. Run contradiction metabolism
python core/contradiction_engine.py

# 3. Verify ledger integrity
python verify_all.py

✅ Expected result:
All invariants hold — Drift: 0 %, Forks: 0 %, Quorum valid.

9. REST API

Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/scars	Submit new contradiction
PATCH	/api/scars/{id}/resolve	Resolve or update contradiction
GET	/api/ledger/verify	Verify ledger integrity
GET	/api/receipts/{id}	Retrieve signed receipt
POST	/api/governance/vote	Cast quorum vote

10. Security & Reliability Targets

Metric	Target	Description
API Auth Failures	≤ 0.01 %	triggers audit event
Key Revocation Sync	≤ 1 s	propagate across federation
Ledger Drift	0 %	enforced by hash chain
Node Recovery	≤ 30 s	replay from receipts
Test Coverage	≥ 85 %	merge approval threshold

Security goal: make trust falsifiable—assume compromise, verify recovery.

11. Cold-Agent Prompting Protocol
	1.	Epistemic Reset — start from zero; no hidden bias.
	2.	Declarative Build Contracts — every prompt defines full deliverables.
	3.	Contradiction as Fuel — conflicts power iteration.
	4.	Governance Frame Embedding — every generation runs under signature context.
	5.	Receipts-First Discipline — outputs are auditable artifacts.
	6.	Governed Autonomy Bandwidth — freedom bounded by policy.
	7.	Auditability as Primitive — traceability over fluency.

Every response is a verifiable artifact; every contradiction, a metabolic event.

13. Verification Workflow

# Temporal logic
tla -config formal/tessrax_ledger.cfg formal/tessrax_ledger.tla
# Logical proof
coqc formal/tessrax_ledger.v
# Relational model
java -jar alloy.jar formal/tessrax_ledger.als

Outputs are hashed into /ledger/formal_receipts.jsonl
→ automatically integrated into the Merkle chain.
