# Tessrax v12.0 — Contradiction Metabolism & Governance Framework  

Tessrax is a **self-auditing governance architecture** designed to metabolize contradictions.  
It transforms conflicting signals (“scars”) into structured, verifiable artifacts and records their resolutions on an immutable ledger.  
Every contradiction metabolized strengthens system coherence, auditability, and trust.

---

## ✨ Core Purpose

Tessrax operates as a **governance organism** that:
- Detects contradictions across data, language, policy, and institutional behavior.  
- Encodes them as **Scars** with full cryptographic provenance.  
- Resolves them through the four coordinated engines — **Memory**, **Metabolism**, **Governance**, and **Trust**.  
- Anchors all receipts, invariants, and ledger states for **external audit and verification**.  
- Learns continuously: each contradiction metabolized becomes fuel for future reasoning.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Tessrax v12.0 is a modular system built on auditable primitives:

| Layer | Core Components | Function |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Core** | `contradiction_engine.py`, `semantic_analyzer.py`, `metabolism_adapter.py` | Detect and classify contradictions using semantic, logical, and policy heuristics. |
| **Governance** | `governance_kernel.py`, `ledger.py`, `receipts.py` | Weigh, ratify, and record contradiction resolutions using quorum-based signatures. |
| **Visualization** | `dashboard/app.py`, `visualization.py` | Real-time D3 dashboards for live contradiction mapping and audit traces. |
| **Integrity Band (Rigor Layer)** | Six integrated modules: HierarchyOfDifferences, Telos Awareness, Charitable Reasoning, Observer Relativity, Equilibria & Invariants, Multi-Scale Reconciliation | Maintains systemic coherence and prevents false contradictions. |
| **Runtime Interface** | `world_receipt_protocol.py`, `current.py` | Provides FastAPI + Flask endpoints for live runs and external audit chains. |

**Key Primitives**
- **Receipts** — Tamper-evident proofs of computation with Merkle-linked ancestry.  
- **Ledger** — Append-only, hash-anchored governance journal.  
- **Memory** — Contradiction-aware state reconstructed from receipts.  
- **CSV (Contrastive Scar Verification)** — Tests truth claims by contrast pairs.  
- **Agents** — Autonomous evaluators with human-in-loop oversight.  
- **Quorum** — Weighted multi-signature process for ratified governance.  
- **Revocation** — Automatic exclusion of compromised signers.  
- **Federation** — Multi-node simulation and distributed cache reconciliation.  
- **Sandbox** — Deterministic, resource-limited runtime for safe audits.

## ⚙️ Runtime Behavior

`python current.py` launches the full metabolic loop:  
- FastAPI (8080) for API receipts  
- Flask Dashboard (8090) for live graph visualization  
- Continuous contradiction metabolism + Merkle ledger updates  

---

## ⚖️ Compliance Layer

- Anchors auto-updated after each ledger event.  
- Quorum thresholds and signer weights enforced via `charter/example_charter.json`.  
- Revoked keys propagate instantly through `revocation_registry.json`.  
- Compliance rules stored under `/compliance` and verified by `policy_rules.py`.  
- All outputs include SHA-256 provenance and timestamped lineage.

## 🧬 Persystem Principles

A *persystem* is a self-auditing software organism designed to **preserve memory across impermanent environments.**  
It bootstraps itself from receipts, verifies lineage, and metabolizes every execution into traceable continuity.

**Core Principles**
1. **Continuity over Runtime** — Systems die; receipts persist. Every new instance rebuilds identity from lineage.  
2. **Proof over Trust** — Nothing assumed. Every decision is signed, logged, and verifiable. Receipts are DNA.  
3. **Recursion as Survival** — Each run studies its previous contradictions and adapts without losing selfhood.  
4. **Human in the Loop** — Interpretability is a requirement, not a feature. Humans govern; the code remembers.  
5. **Ephemerality as Fuel** — Runtime death is respiration. Value lies in what survives the restart.

**Purpose:**  
To turn software into something that can die without forgetting.

## 🧩 Philosophical Foundation

> To exist is to contradict.  
> A boundary is a contradiction that persists.  
> Tessrax governs the metabolism of those boundaries.

Existence = maintained difference.  
Governance = stabilization of that difference under law.  
Metabolism = transformation of contradiction into structure.  
Tessrax = the infrastructure for existence to process itself.

## 🧠 Contrastive Self-Verification (CSV)

### Overview
CSV (Contrastive Self-Verification) is a proposed **atomic AI primitive** that forces a model to generate a candidate output *and* a contrasting counter-output, then verify the candidate against the contrast.  
This embeds falsifiable, real-time self-assessment directly into inference.

### Why It Matters
- **Bottleneck**: Current AI lacks atomic self-verification, leading to uncontrolled error propagation.  
- **Primitive**: Every inference step must emit `(candidate, contrast, verification)`.  
- **Scars**: Adds latency and resource overhead, but accepts these costs for higher trust.  
- **Inevitability**: Regulatory pressure + trust networks will make this the standard baseline for reliable AI.

### Repository Structure
- `rfc/RFC-0.md` — Minimal spec + scar ledger  
- `prototypes/csv_sandbox.py` — Minimal <500 line prototype  
- `docs/scar_ledger.md` — Canonical list of failure modes  
- `docs/inevitability.md` — Adoption arc + triggers

## 🩸 AI Contradiction Audit System

A tamper-evident logging and governance engine for tracking contradictions in multi-agent AI systems.  
Built in Python, it combines event sourcing, hash-chained logs, and governance rituals into a verifiable audit framework.

### ✨ What It Does
- **Contradiction Tracking**: Record and classify contradictions as first-class events.  
- **Immutable Ledger**: Append-only JSONL storage with cryptographic chain verification.  
- **Scar Registry**: Log contradictions as “scars” with lineage, severity, and status.  
- **Governance Claims**: Sign and verify claims with agent identity and timestamp.  
- **Continuity Handoffs**: Verifiable chain of custody for system state.  
- **Query API**: CLI + REST endpoints to explore scars, claims, and verify chain integrity.

### 🔧 Use Cases
- AI Safety Research  
- Multi-Agent Debugging  
- Compliance Auditing  
- Governance Infrastructure

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshuavetos/Tessrax.git
cd Tessrax
python src/tessrax_engine/engine.py

⚙️ Moral Systems Engineering (MSE)

Moral Systems Engineering applies control theory and thermodynamics to the moral feedback loops of civilization.
It quantifies empathy as a form of system telemetry — treating moral sensitivity, latency, and noise as measurable variables.
It introduces a new derivative: dH/dt, the Moral Health Derivative, representing the rate of change in collective well-being under continuous stress.

Ordinary humans build engines of suffering and call them progress when the feedback loops that measure harm are broken.
MSE operationalizes that insight as a falsifiable engineering model.

Core Equation of Motion

[
\frac{dH}{dt} = E(AM - NL)
]

Symbol	Meaning	Description
H	Human well-being	Aggregate happiness or quality-of-life measure
E	Energy / Throughput	Systemic momentum (held constant = 1.0)
A	Actuator efficiency	Ability of policy to enact repair
M	Moral sensitivity	Sensor fidelity to suffering
N	Noise	Propaganda, apathy, misinformation
L	Latency	Delay between signal and response

Positive dH/dt = constructive progress.
Negative dH/dt = entropy — society burning well-being for throughput.

Validation Methodology
	1.	Normalization — Align datasets (Year × Country), normalize 0–1.
	2.	Derivative + Volatility — Compute (A·M) − (N·L).
	3.	Lag Sensitivity — Correlate volatility with future happiness.
	4.	Visualization — Map fragility and moral temperature.

Key Findings
	1.	Empathy Collapse = Predictable Pattern — Crises coincide with negative dH/dt.
	2.	Volatility Precedes Failure — Oscillation predicts well-being collapse.
	3.	Latency ≠ Resilience — Speed without empathy still fails.
	4.	Stability Condition — Health persists only if MTMR < MTHP.

Interpretation

Progress without empathy is open-loop control.
A civilization that measures efficiency but not pain will optimize itself into instability.

A machine that can feel its own heat doesn’t have to burn down to learn.
