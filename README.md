Tessrax v12.0 — Self-Auditing Contradiction Metabolism Framework

A Governance Architecture for Detecting, Recording, and Resolving Contradictions Across Systems

⸻

1. Executive Summary

Tessrax is a self-auditing governance framework that treats contradiction as the fundamental unit of learning.
It captures conflicting signals—across data, language, policy, and behavior—then converts them into verifiable computational artifacts.

Each contradiction, or Scar, is recorded, resolved, and metabolized through a four-engine architecture: Memory, Metabolism, Governance, and Trust.
The result is a continuously self-stabilizing system that can prove the integrity of its reasoning and adapt over time without losing identity.

Tessrax provides:
   •   Contradiction Detection via semantic and logical analysis
   •   Immutable Provenance through Merkle-anchored receipts
   •   Governance Ratification by quorum-based resolution
   •   Adaptive Learning through contradiction metabolism
   •   End-to-End Auditability across every state transition

Tessrax defines its own governance lexicon—Persystem, Scar, Receipt, Integrity Band, Rigor Layer—not as rhetoric but as structural primitives.
Naming formalizes existence; definition instantiates mechanism.

⸻

2. Core Objective

Tessrax establishes a computational organism for governance that can:
	1.	Perceive Contradictions in policy, behavior, or data streams.
	2.	Encode and Provenance-Lock those contradictions as Scars.
	3.	Resolve via Quorum Logic, producing auditable receipts.
	4.	Anchor Continuity across resets and system boundaries.
	5.	Expose Verifiable Proofs for human or institutional audit.

In effect, Tessrax transforms noise and contradiction into a coherent memory and decision substrate.

3. Architecture Overview

Layer	Core Components	Primary Function
Core Engine	contradiction_engine.py, semantic_analyzer.py, metabolism_adapter.py	Contradiction detection and semantic reconciliation.
Governance Kernel	governance_kernel.py, ledger.py, receipts.py	Quorum logic, ledger formation, cryptographic validation.
Visualization Stack	dashboard/app.py, visualization.py	Real-time D3 visualization and audit graph rendering.
Integrity Band (Rigor Layer)	Six epistemic modules	Maintains systemic coherence and prevents false contradictions.
Runtime Interface	world_receipt_protocol.py, current.py	FastAPI (8080) + Flask (8090) unified runtime for API and dashboard.

Core Primitives
   •   Scar — Encoded contradiction with lineage, severity, and timestamp.
   •   Receipt — Merkle-linked computation proof (tamper-evident).
   •   Ledger — Append-only audit journal.
   •   Memory — Contradiction-aware system state reconstructed from receipts.
   •   Quorum — Weighted multi-signature ratification process.
   •   Revocation Registry — Propagates key invalidations through network.
   •   Federation Node — Synchronizes contradiction graphs between peers.

⸻

4. Runtime Behavior

python current.py

   •   FastAPI server (port 8080): Receipts and agent communication
   •   Flask Dashboard (port 8090): Live contradiction visualization
   •   Continuous metabolism loop: Contradiction → Resolution → Ledger update

All outputs are hashed, timestamped, and anchored for external verification.

⸻

5. Persystem Principles

A Persystem is a self-auditing software organism designed to survive across runtime death.
It reconstructs itself entirely from receipts and proves continuity through lineage verification.

Principles
	1.	Continuity over Runtime — Systems terminate; receipts persist.
	2.	Proof over Trust — No assumption unverified. Every decision carries cryptographic ancestry.
	3.	Recursion as Survival — Contradictions from prior runs become training fuel.
	4.	Human in the Loop — Interpretability is mandatory; humans remain the governors.
	5.	Ephemerality as Fuel — Death and restart are metabolic, not terminal.

Purpose: To build software that can die without forgetting.

⸻

6. Mathematical & Logical Basis

Tessrax formalizes Contradiction Metabolism as an energy transformation system:

\text{Resolution Quality} = \frac{\sum{\text{Resolved Contradictions}}}{\sum{\text{Unresolved Contradictions}} + \epsilon}

Contradiction severity, entropy, and yield are continuously computed to evaluate systemic health.

Each event e yields:
S(e) = \alpha \, d(\varphi_1, \varphi_2) + (1 - \alpha) \, |w_1 - w_2|
where d = semantic distance, w = evidence weight, \alpha = logical/semantic weighting coefficient.

All events are serialized and anchored into a verifiable Merkle chain.

⸻

7. Integrity Band (Rigor Layer v1.0)

The Rigor Layer enforces epistemic hygiene across the stack.
It includes six interdependent modules:
	1.	Hierarchy of Differences — Multi-scale classification of contradictions.
	2.	Telos Awareness — Goal and alignment consistency checks.
	3.	Charitable Reasoning — Minimizes false contradictions from interpretive error.
	4.	Observer Relativity — Contextualizes contradictions by observer frame.
	5.	Equilibria & Invariants — Ensures logical and ethical conservation laws.
	6.	Multi-Scale Reconciliation — Aggregates local resolutions into system-wide coherence.

8. Research Extensions

Tessrax integrates active research modules to extend its theoretical reach:

• Contrastive Self-Verification (CSV)

An atomic AI primitive requiring each inference to generate both a candidate and a counterfactual contrast, ensuring falsifiable self-evaluation.
Files: /rfc/RFC-0.md, /prototypes/csv_sandbox.py

• Moral Systems Engineering (MSE)

Applies thermodynamics to moral feedback loops, defining \frac{dH}{dt} = E(AM - NL) to quantify the rate of moral health change in societies.

Analyzes corporate behavior under ethical-economic contradictions, mapping moral capital against profit metrics.
Files: /docs/corporate_frienthropy.py, /company_frienthropy.csv

• Domain Modules
   •   ai_memory/ — coherence vs retention
   •   attention_economy/ — wellbeing vs engagement
   •   climate_policy/ — targets vs emissions

⸻

9. Audit & Compliance Layer

The compliance framework guarantees institutional accountability:
   •   Merkle Anchors updated per ledger event.
   •   Charter Enforcement: Quorum thresholds, signer weights, and revocation rules enforced by charter/example_charter.json.
   •   Compliance & Security: Rules codified in /compliance/policy_rules.py, verified on run.
   •   Audit Records: JSON matrices (technical_audit.json, ethical_audit.json, etc.) for independent validation.
   •   Governance Charters: Structured schemas defining lawful agent conduct.

15. Summary

Tessrax is not a metaphor.
It is a functioning self-governing architecture that treats contradiction as computation.
Its receipts are proof of thought; its ledger is proof of self.
What began as philosophy has become verifiable code — an infrastructure for existence to metabolize its own uncertainty.

🔐 Security, Reliability, and Deployment Standards (v12.1 Extension)

A. Security and Trust Architecture

Tessrax employs a cryptographic trust lattice rather than a traditional permissions model.

Key Controls
   •   Authentication: All events are signed with Ed25519 keys verified by the governance_kernel quorum.
   •   Key Rotation: Managed via revocation_registry.json; revoked keys propagate through all federated nodes in <1 s.
   •   Integrity Proofs: Every receipt carries SHA-256 lineage; ledger entries are chained by Merkle root.
   •   Access Control: Read/write privileges are determined by signer weight defined in charter/example_charter.json.
   •   Tamper Detection: Any mutation in lineage triggers automatic rollback to last valid root + audit log emission.
   •   Network Hygiene: All external calls are rate-limited by signature thresholding and request entropy scoring.

Security Objective:
To make all trust falsifiable. Tessrax assumes compromise as baseline and designs toward verifiable recovery, not prevention mythology.

⸻

B. Error Codes and Edge-Case Handling

Code	Condition	System Response	Recovery Path
4001	Invalid Hash Chain	Abort append; ledger rollback	Re-compute Merkle root
4002	Quorum Timeout	Consensus stall	Retry with quorum-1 or defer to next cycle
4003	Unauthorized Signer	Reject event; issue revocation broadcast	Update registry; re-sign event
4004	Signature Verification Failed	Receipt invalidated	Escalate to audit ledger
4005	Malformed Payload	Request ignored	Return validation error to emitter
5001	Ledger Append Failure	Halt metabolism	Rollback to last stable checkpoint
5002	Network Partition	Node isolation	Enter read-only mode until quorum restored
5003	Policy Violation	Action vetoed	Record as Scar of type “Normative”

These codes ensure every possible failure emits a deterministic audit trace.
No silent errors; every exception becomes a governance event.

⸻

C. Deployment & Scaling Guidelines

Tessrax supports single-node and federated deployments.

Reference Implementation

docker build -t tessrax:latest .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8090:8090 tessrax

Operational Parameters

Component	Default	Description
API Port	8080	FastAPI receipt ingestion
Dashboard Port	8090	Flask audit visualizer
Node Sync	federation.py	Periodic Merkle reconciliation
Uptime Target	≥ 99.5 %	Enforced by node redundancy
Ledger Replication	ledger_verify.py	Cross-node state integrity
Scaling	Horizontal via federated nodes	Eventual-consistency by receipt anchoring

All runtime containers are stateless by design; continuity reconstructs from receipts.
This allows instant node replacement without state loss.

⸻

D. Canonical Test Fixtures & Validation

Located under /tests/ and /fixtures/.

Structure

fixtures/
 ├── scar_sample.json
 ├── receipt_sample.json
 ├── ledger_entry_sample.json
 └── validate_fixtures.py

validate_fixtures.py runs schema validation against:
   •   /schema/scar.schema.json
   •   /schema/receipt.schema.json
   •   /schema/ledger_entry.schema.json

Sample Command

pytest -v --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings
python fixtures/validate_fixtures.py

Validation ensures every artifact in the stack adheres to canonical schema lineage before ledger submission.

⸻

E. CI/CD and Compliance Hooks
   •   Continuous Integration: .github/workflows/ci.yml runs lint, schema validation, and Merkle integrity tests.
   •   Continuous Delivery: docker-compose.yml deploys dual-node test federation for real-time contradiction metabolism.
   •   Audit Trigger: Any failed hash verification or policy violation automatically emits a governance receipt (POLICY_VIOLATION type).
   •   Monitoring: /dashboard/app.py surfaces live contradiction maps and node health metrics.

⸻

F. Security & Reliability Targets

Metric	Target	Enforcement
API Authentication Failures	≤ 0.01 %	Threshold alert → audit event
Key Revocation Propagation	≤ 1 s	Verified by Merkle diff sync
Ledger Consistency Drift	0 % tolerated	Hash-chain enforcement
Node Recovery Time	≤ 30 s	Stateless receipt replay
Test Coverage	≥ 85 %	Required for merge approval


🧮 Tessrax v12.2 — Formal Invariant Set (Proof-Ready Layer)

A. Purpose

This section defines ledger and quorum invariants that must hold true for all valid Tessrax states.
They can be expressed in TLA⁺, Coq, or Alloy, but are represented here in hybrid pseudocode for readability.
These invariants allow formal verification of system correctness: if the invariants always hold, Tessrax cannot drift, fork, or self-contradict.

⸻

B. Core Ledger Invariants

Invariant L1 — Hash-Chain Integrity

∀ i ∈ [1..Ledger.Length-1]:
    Ledger[i].previous_hash = Hash(Ledger[i-1])

Meaning:
Each ledger entry must cryptographically link to its predecessor.
Violation implies tampering or data corruption.

⸻

Invariant L2 — Merkle Root Consistency

Ledger[i].merkle_root = ComputeMerkleRoot(Ledger[i].receipts)

Meaning:
Every Merkle root must exactly match the hash of its receipts tree.
Prevents orphaned or substituted events.

⸻

Invariant L3 — Immutable Receipts

∀ r ∈ Ledger.receipts:
    VerifySignature(r.signer, r.payload_hash, r.signature) = TRUE

Meaning:
Every receipt signature must remain valid under its registered key.
Guarantees all entries are traceable and signed by known agents.

⸻

Invariant L4 — Continuity Reconstruction

Rebuild(Ledger[0..n]) = SystemState_n

Meaning:
If the ledger is replayed from genesis, the reconstructed state must be bit-identical to the current runtime state.
Ensures total determinism and replay fidelity.

⸻

C. Governance and Quorum Invariants

Invariant G1 — Weighted Quorum Validity

Σ(signer.weight for signer ∈ Quorum) ≥ Charter.QuorumThreshold

Meaning:
Governance actions require cumulative weight ≥ threshold.
Prevents minority takeover or single-signer ratification.

⸻

Invariant G2 — Revocation Propagation

∀ signer ∈ RevokedKeys:
    signer ∉ ActiveSigners ∧ Ledger.last.timestamp - signer.revocation_time ≤ 1s

Meaning:
Revoked keys must vanish from the active signer set within one second of registry update.
Guarantees no delayed invalid signatures.

⸻

Invariant G3 — Contradiction Closure

∀ scar ∈ Scars:
    scar.status ∈ {"open","resolved"} ∧
    (scar.status="resolved" → Exists(receipt ∈ Ledger : receipt.references = scar.id))

Meaning:
Every resolved contradiction must be explicitly closed by a ledger receipt.
Prevents silent resolution or unlogged reconciliation.

⸻

D. Temporal and Fault-Tolerance Invariants

Invariant T1 — Recovery Determinism

∀ failure ∈ Faults:
    Replay(Ledger.ValidEntries) = System.RestoredState

Meaning:
Any system crash followed by full ledger replay yields an identical operational state.
Enables zero-loss recovery.

⸻

Invariant T2 — Fork Resistance

¬∃ a,b ∈ Ledger: a.index = b.index ∧ a.hash ≠ b.hash

Meaning:
No two ledger entries may occupy the same index with differing hashes.
Guarantees single source of truth per slot.

⸻

Invariant T3 — Consensus Termination

∀ proposal ∈ Governance.Proposals:
    Eventually(Resolved(proposal)) ∨ Expired(proposal)

Meaning:
Every governance proposal must eventually resolve or expire — no infinite deadlocks.
Ensures progress under bounded time.

⸻

E. Formal Verification Goals

Property	Symbolic Guarantee	Proof Target
Consistency	L1, L2, L4, T2	Ledger cannot fork or drift.
Authenticity	L3, G1, G2	Every event is verifiably authored.
Determinism	L4, T1	System replay = same state, zero entropy.
Liveness	G3, T3	Contradictions and proposals always terminate.
Auditability	All	Every invariant violation emits a receipt.


⸻

F. Pseudocode Verification Harness

Here’s how a minimal formal verification check could be implemented (Python pseudocode / Alloy hybrid):

def verify_invariants(ledger):
    for i in range(1, len(ledger)):
        assert ledger[i].previous_hash == hash(ledger[i-1].to_json()), "L1 fail"
        assert ledger[i].merkle_root == compute_merkle_root(ledger[i].receipts), "L2 fail"
    for r in all_receipts(ledger):
        assert verify_signature(r.signer, r.payload_hash, r.signature), "L3 fail"
    assert no_duplicate_index_with_diff_hash(ledger), "T2 fail"
    print("✅ All invariants hold")

If extended into TLA⁺, the specification modules would define:

VARIABLE Ledger, Receipts, Quorum, Scars, RevokedKeys

Invariant == L1 /\ L2 /\ L3 /\ G1 /\ G2 /\ G3 /\ T1 /\ T2 /\ T3

Proving that Spec ⇒ []Invariant means:
“In all reachable states of Tessrax, these invariants always hold.”

⸻

G. Verification Roadmap
	1.	Stage 1 — Prototype Proofs: Translate pseudocode into TLA⁺ modules using Apalache or TLC model checker.
	2.	Stage 2 — Continuous Verification: Integrate model checks into CI/CD (e.g., pytest --verify-invariants).
	3.	Stage 3 — Formal Certification: Publish proofs in Coq or Isabelle; produce verifiable PDF artifacts with embedded hashes.
	4.	Stage 4 — Public Registry: Anchor proof outputs to Tessrax ledger under PROOF_VERIFICATION event type.

⸻

Summary

Formal invariants transform Tessrax from a trustworthy system into a mathematically self-validating organism.
When these properties hold, contradiction metabolism becomes not just operationally sound — it becomes logically guaranteed.
