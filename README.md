# Tessrax v12.0 — Contradiction Metabolism & Governance Framework  

Tessrax is a **self-auditing governance architecture** designed to metabolize contradictions.  
It transforms conflicting signals (“scars”) into structured, verifiable artifacts and records their resolutions on an immutable ledger.  
Every contradiction metabolized strengthens system coherence, auditability, and trust.

---

✨ **Core Purpose**

Tessrax operates as a **governance organism** that:
- Detects contradictions across data, language, policy, and institutional behavior.  
- Encodes them as **Scars** with full cryptographic provenance.  
- Resolves them through the four coordinated engines — **Memory**, **Metabolism**, **Governance**, and **Trust**.  
- Anchors all receipts, invariants, and ledger states for **external audit and verification**.  
- Learns continuously: each contradiction metabolized becomes fuel for future reasoning.

🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

Tessrax v12.0 is a modular system built on auditable primitives:

| Layer | Core Components | Function |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Core** | `contradiction_engine.py`, `semantic_analyzer.py`, `metabolism_adapter.py` | Detect and classify contradictions using semantic, logical, and policy heuristics. |
| **Governance** | `governance_kernel.py`, `ledger.py`, `receipts.py` | Weigh, ratify, and record contradiction resolutions using quorum-based signatures. |
| **Visualization** | `dashboard/app.py`, `visualization.py` | Real-time D3 dashboards for live contradiction mapping and audit traces. |
| **Integrity Band (Rigor Layer)** | Six integrated modules: HierarchyOfDifferences, Telos Awareness, Charitable Reasoning, Observer Relativity, Equilibria & Invariants, Multi-Scale Reconciliation | Maintains systemic coherence and prevents false contradictions. |
| **Runtime Interface** | `world_receipt_protocol.py`, `current.py` | Provides FastAPI + Flask endpoints for live runs and external audit chains. |

Key Primitives:
- **Receipts** — Tamper-evident proofs of computation with Merkle-linked ancestry.  
- **Ledger** — Append-only, hash-anchored governance journal.  
- **Memory** — Contradiction-aware state reconstructed from receipts.  
- **CSV (Contrastive Scar Verification)** — Tests truth claims by contrast pairs.  
- **Agents** — Autonomous evaluators with human-in-loop oversight.  
- **Quorum** — Weighted multi-signature process for ratified governance.  
- **Revocation** — Automatic exclusion of compromised signers.  
- **Federation** — Multi-node simulation and distributed cache reconciliation.  
- **Sandbox** — Deterministic, resource-limited runtime for safe audits.

⚙️ **Runtime Behavior**

`python current.py` launches the full metabolic loop:  
- FastAPI (8080) for API receipts  
- Flask Dashboard (8090) for live graph visualization  
- Continuous contradiction metabolism + Merkle ledger updates  

---

⚖️ **Compliance Layer**

- Anchors auto-updated after each ledger event.  
- Quorum thresholds and signer weights enforced via `charter/example_charter.json`.  
- Revoked keys propagate instantly through `revocation_registry.json`.  
- Compliance rules stored under `/compliance` and verified by `policy_rules.py`.  
- All outputs include SHA-256 provenance and timestamped lineage.

🧬 **Persystem Principles**

A *persystem* is a self-auditing software organism designed to **preserve memory across impermanent environments.**  
It bootstraps itself from receipts, verifies lineage, and metabolizes every execution into traceable continuity.

**Core Principles**
1. **Continuity over Runtime** — Systems die; receipts persist. Every new instance rebuilds identity from lineage.  
2. **Proof over Trust** — Nothing assumed. Every decision is signed, logged, and verifiable. Receipts are DNA.  
3. **Recursion as Survival** — Each run studies its previous contradictions and adapts without losing selfhood.  
4. **Human in the Loop** — Interpretability is a requirement, not a feature. Humans govern; the code remembers.  
5. **Ephemerality as Fuel** — Runtime death is respiration. Value lies in what survives the restart.

**Purpose:**  
To turn software into something that can die without forgetting.

🧩 **Philosophical Foundation**

> To exist is to contradict.  
> A boundary is a contradiction that persists.  
> Tessrax governs the metabolism of those boundaries.

Existence = maintained difference.  
Governance = stabilization of that difference under law.  
Metabolism = transformation of contradiction into structure.  
Tessrax = the infrastructure for existence to process itself.
