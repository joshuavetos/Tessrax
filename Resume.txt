2. Portfolio Snapshot (1-page PDF concept)

Title: AI Workflow Documentation Example
   •   Workflow Log Diagram (simple boxes: Input → Error → Log → Corrective Update → Documented Schema).
   •   Caption: “Example of a corrective feedback loop I designed to capture errors from multi-agent tasks, log them in a structured way, and translate into corrective updates. This reduced repeated errors and ensured reproducibility.”
   •   Bonus (Optional): Add a second mini-example, like a simple JSON schema excerpt for logging.

This should be 1 page, light graphics, plain-text captions. It shows evidence of doing, not just talking.

Hi [Name],

I came across your team’s work on [Company/Product], and noticed you’re growing in AI operations and product support. My background is in workflow design and documentation — I’ve coordinated multi-agent AI systems, authored schemas, and created error-handling processes that improve reliability. 

I’d love to connect and see if my skills in AI ops and documentation might support your team’s goals.

Best,  
Josh Vetos
