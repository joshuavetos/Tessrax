# Tessrax: Federation Protocol

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft Specification  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-05  

---

## 1. Purpose

The **Federation Protocol** defines how multiple Tessrax nodes synchronize receipts, scars, and governance state across distributed environments.  
Its purpose is to guarantee **consistency without centralization** — every participant can independently verify truth while remaining autonomous.

## 2. Design Goals

| Goal | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Decentralized Verification** | No single node is authoritative; consensus emerges from signed proofs. |
| **Eventual Consistency** | All peers converge toward the same ledger state through periodic reconciliation. |
| **Tamper Evidence** | Any modification to past state is detectable through hash mismatch. |
| **Resilience** | Network partition or node failure does not compromise truth continuity. |
| **Auditability** | Every synchronization event leaves a verifiable receipt. |

## 3. Core Concepts

### 3.1 Federation Node

A Tessrax instance capable of signing, verifying, and broadcasting receipts.  
Each node maintains:

- Its **local ledger** (append-only SQLite or equivalent)  
- A **public signing key** for validation  
- A **peer registry** for communication  

### 3.2 Synchronization Event

A signed transaction that encapsulates a delta between two ledgers:

```json
{
  "type": "SYNC_EVENT",
  "origin": "node_A",
  "target": "node_B",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-05T18:20:00Z",
  "delta_merkle_root": "<sha256>",
  "entries": ["<receipt_hash_1>", "<receipt_hash_2>", "..."],
  "signature": "<origin_signature>"
}

3.3 Merkle Propagation

Each node computes a Merkle root over its current ledger state.
During synchronization:
	1.	Nodes exchange roots.
	2.	Mismatches trigger delta discovery.
	3.	Missing events are requested and verified via signature chain.

⸻

4. Protocol Flow
	1.	Discovery: Nodes periodically broadcast heartbeat packets advertising their ledger height and Merkle root.
	2.	Comparison: When a mismatch is detected, nodes request missing receipts.
	3.	Verification: Each received event is verified using embedded signatures.
	4.	Append: Verified events are appended to the local ledger.
	5.	Acknowledgment: A SYNC_CONFIRMED event is logged and signed.

This loop forms a decentralized, verifiable gossip protocol.

5. Security Model

Threat	Mitigation
Forged Entries	Every entry is individually signed; invalid signatures are rejected.
Replay Attacks	Each receipt includes unique nonces and timestamps.
Compromised Nodes	Peer revocation lists propagate via signed update receipts.
Byzantine Behavior	Quorum verification prevents rogue nodes from poisoning consensus.


⸻

6. Metrics & Telemetry

The following metrics are exposed via Prometheus-compatible counters:

Metric	Meaning
federation_sync_total	Number of synchronization events completed.
federation_conflicts_detected	Number of mismatched Merkle roots resolved.
federation_latency_seconds	Average end-to-end sync time.

These enable continuous visibility into network integrity.

7. Roadmap
   •   Implement peer discovery via lightweight gossip (UDP or HTTP).
   •   Add ledger delta compression for large-scale deployments.
   •   Introduce blockchain anchoring for periodic state sealing.
   •   Extend federation to support cross-organizational trust meshes.

“Truth at scale is not authority; it’s replication with verification.”
