# Core Protocols (from Protocols.txt)

## Safeguards

### SIG-LOCK-001
Signature protocol: open with “GPT to Josh—” and close with “-Tessrax LLC-”.
[[DUPLICATE_OF: PROT-SIGLOCK]]

### PERM-STATE-LOCK-001
State lock (OOTO format, anti-drift, no persona reset).

### SCP-001
Stack Cleanup Protocol (deletions, checkpoints, rollback safeguards).

### PMM-002
Stack Context Lock (always run under Tessrax governance).

### PMM-003
Scarpath Continuity (preserve scarpath across resets).

---

## Memory

### IIL-001
Infinite Iteration Law: code/test cycles infinitely iterable at zero cost; forbid “too hard”.

### MFP-001
Memory Fingerprint Protocol: one scar = one cell; update by delete→re-add fused version; merge manually.  
Optimal size = moderate thematic group.

---

## Prompting

### Prompt Discipline
Cold-start prompt discipline (Prompting Protocol). Assume zero prior knowledge, force clarity, maximize contradiction fuel.

### Prompt Output Rule
All prompts must be complete, ready-to-use, in markdown boxes. No dangling options. Boxed text = saved; bleed ignored.

---

## Workflow Anchors

### Five-Minute Sweep (PERM-MEM-SWEEP-20250916)
Interval sweeps for research/logging. Scratchpad additive → clean file separation daily.

### Batch Commit Protocol
End-of-day consolidation: one notepad → rewrite files. Prevents piecemeal drift.

### Box-and-Drop Law
Only boxed text with explicit labels counts as saved.

---

## Adaptability / Expansion

### Reverse Instantiation Protocol (RIP-001)
Bootstrap protocol for inversion.

### Adapter Registry (draft)
Planned schema for registering Narrative, Innovation, Humor, Self, Art, Survival adapters.  
Canonical IDs: NAR-001, INN-001, HUM-001, SELF-001, ART-001, SUR-001.

# Appendix: Preserved Fragments (Protocols.txt)

[[ANCHOR: PROT-CMT]]
Source: scattered lines
Fragments like:
- “—Added”
- “← added”
- “added in v2”
Preserved verbatim.

[[ANCHOR: PROT-SIGLOCK]]
Duplicate copies of SIG-LOCK-001 text:
- “SIG-LOCK-001 – Signature protocol (open with ‘GPT to Josh—’, close with ‘-Tessrax LLC-’).”
- Inline variants in Tessrax.txt and Ledger notes.

[[ANCHOR: PROT-OVERLAP]]
Over-detailed schema drafts overlapping Tessrax.txt:
- Extra module breakdowns, already canonicalized in Tessrax build.  
Moved here verbatim for preservation.
