# Tessrax Compliance Readiness Summary

## Overview
Tessrax is engineered for verifiable integrity and governance.  
All critical operations—data intake, contradiction detection, ledger updates, and governance events—are cryptographically signed, sandbox-isolated, and fully auditable.

---

## 1. Data Integrity
- **Ed25519 Signatures:** Every ledger receipt is signed with an asymmetric key pair.  
- **Hash Chaining & Merkle Anchoring:** Each entry links to the previous; the Merkle root is anchored externally (e.g., Git commits).  
- **Session Hashing:** Daily session hashes and signatures (`sign_session.sh`) provide immutable end-of-day proofs.

---

## 2. Access & Execution Controls
- **RestrictedPython Sandbox:** Replaces `exec()` for controlled code execution.  
- **Container Isolation:** Recommended Docker runtime with non-privileged user.  
- **/data/ Directory Enforcement:** All file I/O confined to designated sandbox.  
- **Memory & CPU Limits:** Hard limits prevent denial-of-service or runaway processes.

---

## 3. Governance Enforcement
- **Pre-Receive Hook:** Pushes that violate charter rules are automatically rejected.  
- **CI Mirror Checks:** GitHub Actions replicate local enforcement for parity.  
- **Governance Kernel:** Monitors ledger events in real time and validates against charter criteria.

---

## 4. Cryptographic Key Management
- **Automated Rotation:** `key_rotation.py` rotates keys on a 90-day schedule.  
- **Revocation List:** `keys/revoked.json` invalidates compromised or retired keys.  
- **Archived Keys:** Previous public keys retained for historical verification.

---

## 5. Monitoring & Observability
- **Prometheus Metrics:** Exposes counters (`EVENTS_COUNTER`, `FAILURES_COUNTER`) and histograms (`MERKLE_LATENCY`) at `/metrics`.  
- **Atomic Ledger Writes:** Aggregator model ensures race-free, lock-secured updates.  
- **Failure Logging:** All exceptions produce structured `FAILURE_EVENT` receipts.

---

## 6. Benchmarking & Performance
- **`benchmark_runner.py`:** Measures throughput, latency, and edge count under load.  
- **Version-Pinned Dependencies:** `requirements.txt` locks all third-party libraries for reproducibility.

---

## 7. Compliance & Audit Readiness
This system’s design supports:
- **Integrity Verification:** All events are independently verifiable via public keys.  
- **Non-Repudiation:** Signatures bind each action to a specific authorized key.  
- **Traceability:** Complete provenance of every modification and contradiction.  
- **Operational Continuity:** Federation nodes auto-heal on consensus drift.

Tessrax meets the baseline expectations for SOC-2 style integrity and traceability controls, with transparent cryptographic proof of all ledger events.
