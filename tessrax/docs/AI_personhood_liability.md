# AI Personhood for Liability – Governance Options (Tessrax Kernel v1.0)

## Option A — Kernel Recommendation  
**Reject Legal Personhood for AI; Enforce Vicarious Human Liability with Compensation Fund**

**Summary**  
Governments should **not** grant autonomous systems any form of legal personhood. Liability must remain traceable to humans and organizations that design, deploy, or profit from those systems.  
A mandatory **AI Liability Insurance Fund** ensures victims are compensated even when fault attribution is complex.

**Rationale**
1. **Accountability:** Prevents corporate shielding via artificial “AI entities.”  
2. **Legal Clarity:** Retains current negligence and product liability frameworks.  
3. **Ethical Integrity:** Machines lack moral agency; humans stay responsible.  
4. **Economic Fairness:** Fund internalizes systemic risk without stifling innovation.

**Mechanism**
- Strict vicarious liability for developers/operators  
- Mandatory AI Liability Fund (proportional levy per deployment scale)  
- Transparent claims + actuarial risk pricing  
- Regulatory oversight and enforcement

**Supporting Precedents**
- EU AI Act (2024) – rejects AI personhood  
- OECD AI Principles (2019) – human accountability  
- FTC Guidance (2023) – prohibits deceptive delegation of responsibility

## Option B — Minority View  
**Grant Limited Procedural Personhood for Service of Process**

**Summary**  
Autonomous systems may be assigned a **narrow procedural legal identity** to simplify litigation.  
This identity serves only for lawsuits or accountability tracking—not moral or property rights.

**Rationale**
1. **Efficiency:** Enables direct service of process for autonomous actions.  
2. **Transparency:** Maintains verifiable registry ID per system.  
3. **Precedent:** Mirrors corporate and maritime procedural personhood.

**Safeguards**
- No moral/property rights  
- Mandatory mapping AI ID → responsible human entity  
- Sunset clause + regulator renewal requirement  
- Nullified if used to evade responsibility

**Risks**
- Concept creep → “rights” expansion  
- Jurisdictional inconsistency

## Governance Summary

| Option | Core Principle | Pros | Risks |
|--------|----------------|------|-------|
| **A – Vicarious Liability + Fund** | Humans remain sole legal actors | Clear accountability; compatible with existing law | Administrative overhead |
| **B – Procedural Personhood** | AI gains ID for service of process | Simplifies litigation; improves traceability | Risk of rights creep; uneven global adoption |
