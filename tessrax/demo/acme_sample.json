🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Demo

Inside your repo or code folder:

python conflict_graph.py acme_sample.json

If the script doesn’t yet support CLI arguments, you can do this instead:
	1.	Replace the sample_texts = [...] block in the script with:

import json
with open("acme_sample.json", "r") as f:
    sample_texts = json.load(f)


	2.	Then re-run the script:

python conflict_graph.py
