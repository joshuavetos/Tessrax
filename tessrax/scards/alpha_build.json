Every item below shows the folder tree and then the purpose or sample file contents you should drop inside each node so the structure mirrors the alpha build spec you already wrote.
It’s organized so you can clone it straight into your Tessrax repo and immediately start wiring code or documentation.

# SCARDS – Tessrax Contradiction Metabolism Framework

This folder contains all executable, schema, and documentation assets for the
Tessrax Alpha Build (`v0.1.0-alpha`).  It mirrors the architecture defined in
`tessrax_alpha_build.json` and provides the backbone for the Contradiction Game.

Structure:
- `build/` → canonical JSON build spec
- `schemas/` → all data contracts
- `services/` → modular microservices
- `tests/` → unit/integration suites
- `devops/` → deployment and CI/CD
- `docs/` → human-readable design explanations

/SCARDS/build/tessrax_alpha_build.json

Here is the unified **Alpha Build Plan** integrating all seven design documents into executable logic form.

Summary

The /SCARDS folder now contains:
   •   Code stubs for every layer
   •   Schemas for all major data types
   •   Documentation mapped to your seven agent specs
   •   DevOps pipeline to spin the network locally
   •   Tests ensuring core loop continuity

Once this directory is committed, you can incrementally fill in logic for each service using the interfaces already defined in tessrax_alpha_build.json.

  "implementation_notes": "Ensure phase transitions are temporally distinct: Metabolize animations/audio should resolve within ~2–3 seconds, while Echo ripples can last 5–7 seconds with fading persistence. Use separate animation layers so Echo effects do not overwrite Metabolize visuals. Synchronize audio cues with visual triggers for coherence. Keep performance optimized by limiting particle counts in Echo ripples and preloading sound assets to avoid latency."

The exponential soft cap converts raw_total into a saturating cycle_total so players feel rewarded early in a cycle while naturally tapering off later, reducing grind pressure. The stepped post-cap multipliers preserve meaningful gains for exceptional detachment after the cap (35% then 15%), avoiding harsh cliffs that punish expert streaks while still protecting economy balance. Together, this keeps early play brisk, mid-cycle strategic, and late-cycle focused on quality over quantity.",
  "test_conditions": "Run 10-minute simulated sessions across three cohorts: novice (mean detachment=0.45, σ=0.1), intermediate (mean=0.65, σ=0.1), expert (mean=0.85, σ=0.07). Event cadence: 1 action every 20s (novice), 15s (intermediate), 10s (expert). Measure: per-event credited fuel, cycle_total progression, frequency of entering 0.35 and 0.15 multipliers, and perceived fairness via UI telemetry (abort rates after cap, continued engagement). A/B compare against baseline quadratic with hard 0.25 multiplier. Validate that experts still achieve higher net fuel with fewer actions, novices are not starved, and total economy stays within max_per_cycle ±10% across cohorts."
