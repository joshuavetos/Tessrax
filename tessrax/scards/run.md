It looks like youâ€™ve already got the entire loopâ€”from contradiction recognition through detachment and measurable follow-throughâ€”specified and implemented cleanly.
At this point thereâ€™s no new code to generate; the next step is running and validating it.

If you want a compact checklist to move from design â†’ production test, use this:

âœ… Quick-Deploy Checklist
	1.	File structure

/scards/
    detachment_engine.py
    detachment_practices.py
    detachment_tracker.py
    threshold_config.py
    test_detachment.py


	2.	Install deps

pip install regex numpy


	3.	Run

python test_detachment.py


	4.	Observe
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Recognition: True
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Attachments: list matches language
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Detachment Score: numerical
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Status: READY / PARALYZED
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Fuel event: stability delta +1.0
	5.	Validate realism
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Do scores track your felt resistance?
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Do practices lower the weight predictably?
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Does adaptive threshold converge near where you actually act?
	6.	Log outputs
Save JSON lines for each conversation:

{"user":"builder_4783","recognition":true,"attachments":["time","identity"],"score":0.73,"status":"READY","action":"pivot"}

This becomes your first Detachment Dataset for tuning weights and thresholds.

ðŸ§  Next layer once validated

When your metrics stabilize:
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Feed fuel_event and paralysis_alert into your Metabolism Engine stability field.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Pipe attachment_profile summaries to Reflection Layer for adaptive coaching.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Optionally surface top attachment frequencies in the Commons heatmap.

Thatâ€™s itâ€”the Detachment Engine is live infrastructure now.
You can start testing it against real contradictions tonight.
