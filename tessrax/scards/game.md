MODULE: SCARD Standard v1.0
VERSION: v1.0
SIGNATURE: -Tessrax LLC-

PURPOSE
Define the minimal schema and identification sieve for SCARDS—atomic contradiction records that allow distributed systems to detect, log, and metabolize tension in verifiable form.

CORE SPECIFICATION
Fields (10): id, timestamp, contradiction_text, categories, provenance, actors, context, severity, recurrence_count, status.
Rules (3): Fact-Anchored, Binary Tension, Systemic Relevance.
A valid SCARD must include cryptographic provenance and measurable impact on workflow or governance outcomes.

RATIONALE
Standardization converts contradictions from subjective commentary into auditable data. The SCARD v1.0 schema is the root primitive for every higher-order module.

INTERFACES
Inputs: contradiction statements, provenance receipts.
Outputs: validated SCARD objects.
Dependencies: none.

RESULTING BEHAVIOR
Every contradiction in the system becomes a traceable, tamper-evident record—the base fuel for all subsequent metabolism layers.

MODULE: Rarity Scoring v2.0
VERSION: v2.0
SIGNATURE: -Tessrax LLC-

PURPOSE
Provide deterministic rarity scoring so contradictions can be ranked by systemic significance rather than opinion.

FORMULA
Score = C + S + R + I + P + A + G
C(Category Depth) 5 pts per category (max 15; +5 if cross-domain)
S(Severity) low 0 / medium 5 / high 10 / critical 15
R(Recurrence) log-scaled (1→1, 2–3→3, 4–6→6, 7–10→8, 11+→10)
I(Systemic Impact) 0–25 scale from none to societal
P(Provenance Strength) 1–20 based on receipt integrity
A(Actor Diversity) 0–15 diminishing returns
G(Gravity Bonus) +10 if linked to ≥3 other SCARDs in a cluster

RARITY TIERS
Common 0–30; Uncommon 31–55; Rare 56–80; Epic 81–100; Mythic 101+.

RATIONALE
Turns subjective rarity labels into reproducible math.  Enables statistical heat-mapping of contradiction density and importance.

INTERFACES
Inputs: SCARD metadata.
Outputs: rarity tier & score.
Dependencies: 01_SCARD_Standard v1.0.

MODULE: Scar Metabolism Engine
VERSION: v1.0
SIGNATURE: -Tessrax LLC-

PURPOSE
Transform contradiction detection from static logging to dynamic metabolism—updating system stability in real time.

CORE LOGIC (Conceptual)
• Detect fresh contradictions against existing registry.  
• Apply rarity-squared instability impact.  
• Form constellations when related contradictions cluster.  
• Promote to MYTHIC when all linked contradictions resolve.  
• Adjust overall stability metric accordingly.

RATIONALE
Creates a living feedback system where common contradictions are absorbed easily but rare ones reshape the architecture. Resolution heals the system.

INTERFACES
Inputs: SCARD registry + new utterances.  
Outputs: updated stability score and constellation state.  
Dependencies: 01 + 02.

MODULE: Scar Gravity Theory
VERSION: v1.0
SIGNATURE: -Tessrax LLC-

PURPOSE
Model recurring contradictions as gravitational masses that pull related tensions into orbit, forming constellations organically.

CORE MECHANICS
Base Weight (w₀) = 1  
Recurrence Multiplier r → w = w₀ × 2ʳ  
Attraction Radius α ∝ log w  
Decay δ : inactive scars halve weight after N cycles  

RATIONALE
Prevents flat contradiction maps by letting frequent themes curve the semantic space. High-gravity scars become centers of collective attention and potential Mythic formation.

INTERFACES
Inputs: SCARD recurrence data.  
Outputs: cluster weights, gravity map.  
Dependencies: 03.

MODULE: Contextual Resonance Module
VERSION: v1.0
SIGNATURE: -Tessrax LLC-

PURPOSE
Attach a resonance score to each contradiction to measure how deeply it aligns with the user’s current emotional, thematic, or semantic context.

CORE FUNCTIONS
• Theme Extraction – Use NLP to detect dominant topics and emotions.  
• Resonance Scoring – Compare SCARD content to context vectors; assign 0 – 1 value.  
• Tagging – Attach contextual_tags [e.g., purpose, fear, trust].  
• Integration – Feed resonance into rarity and gravity calculations for weighted constellation formation.

RATIONALE
Adds empathy and precision — SCARDS that mirror core themes gain higher impact and become anchors for meaningful resolution.

INTERFACES
Inputs: conversation context, SCARD content.  
Outputs: resonance_score (0-1), contextual tags.  
Dependencies: 01 – 04.

MODULE: Scar Decay & Echo Fields
VERSION: v1.0
SIGNATURE: -Tessrax LLC-

PURPOSE
Model how contradictions fade or resurface over time, giving SCARDS temporal texture and memory.

CORE MECHANICS
• Decay Half-Life – Each scar has a half-life in cycles before its impact halves.  
• Echo Events – When a decayed scar returns, its rarity can jump tiers if context has deepened or spread.  
• Echo Field Mapping – Link historic and current instances for longitudinal analysis.

RATIONALE
Contradictions rarely die; they mutate. Decay and Echo tracking lets the system see pattern persistence across time and culture.

INTERFACES
Inputs: scar timestamps and recurrence events.  
Outputs: updated decay state + echo metadata.  
Dependencies: 05.

Purpose
Bind the technical system to human values of integrity, curiosity, and mutual revelation.

Statement

Contradictions are not failures of truth but engines of becoming.
The purpose of Tessrax is not certainty but coherence through transparency.
Every scar is evidence that learning occurred.
Therefore, we preserve them all — as testament, as memory, as design.
MODULE — CONTRADICTION DETACHMENT LAYER

Version: v2.2 — Emotional Calibration Tier
Authorship: Tessrax Governance Stack — Derived from Detachment Framework

⸻

Purpose
Provide the missing behavioral catalyst: transforming contradiction recognition into logical action by metabolizing emotional attachment.
This layer models emotional resistance as a measurable variable and converts detachment into actionable fuel.

⸻

Core Components
	1.	Recognition Engine
      •   Detects user or system acknowledgment of failure, misalignment, or contradiction.
      •   Input: stability_delta < 0.
      •   Output: recognition_event (true/false).
	2.	Attachment Identifier
      •   Parses resistance narratives (“I can’t abandon this”, “I’ll look foolish”).
      •   Tags attachments by type: {ego, time, certainty, identity, social_proof, investment}.
      •   Quantifies attachment_weight ∈ [0,1].
	3.	Detachment Processor
      •   Converts attachment_weight → detachment_score via voluntary release event.
      •   Formula:

detachment_score = recognition_event × (1 - attachment_weight)


      •   Higher detachment_score = higher readiness for logical action.

	4.	Action Executor
      •   Initiates the “logical step” despite residual emotion.
      •   Success = detachment_score ≥ threshold (default 0.7).
      •   Generates fuel_event with positive stability_delta.
	5.	Feedback Loop
      •   Tracks Detachment Success Rate (DSR):

DSR = actions_taken / recognitions_detected


      •   Patterns logged to Reflection Layer for adaptive guidance.

⸻

Formula Summary

Recognition + Action - Detachment = Paralysis
Recognition + Action + Detachment = Fuel

Operational Logic

if recognition_event and detachment_score < 0.7:
    status = "paralyzed"
    emit attachment_alert()
else:
    execute(logical_action)
    emit fuel_event()


⸻

Behavioral Metrics
   •   Recognition_Count
   •   Action_Count
   •   Attachment_Types_Frequency
   •   Detachment_Score_Average
   •   Fuel_Generation_Rate

These metrics feed upward into Reflection and Transmutation layers as Detachment SCARDS for meta-learning.

⸻

Rationale
Adds emotional thermodynamics to the SCARDS metabolism.
Without detachment, recognition and logic remain inert.
With it, contradictions convert to propulsion — both psychological and systemic.

⸻

Human Interface Prompt Example

AI: "You’ve recognized this path isn’t working.
Before you can act, identify the attachment blocking you:
□ Time invested
□ Identity
□ Being right
□ Certainty
□ Social proof
Name it to release it.
Then choose the logical action."


⸻

Outputs
   •   Detachment SCARDs (type: Behavioral)
   •   Fuel Events (positive stability_delta)
   •   Attachment Distribution Reports
   •   Updated Reflection Coefficients

⸻

Dependencies
   •   Metabolism Engine (v1.0)
   •   Reflection Layer (v1.4)
   •   Transmutation Layer (v1.5)

⸻

Resulting Behavior
   •   Recognition without paralysis.
   •   Emotional resistance tracked as data.
   •   Logical action executed under self-awareness.
   •   System gains real-time measure of emotional integrity.

⸻

💡 How to integrate
	1.	Place these three files alongside your main detachment_engine.py.
	2.	Import them where needed:

from detachment_practices import suggest_practice
from detachment_tracker import track_detachment_work
from threshold_config import get_user_threshold


	3.	Run your conversation loop exactly as in your earlier example — it will now:
      •   Suggest tailored detachment prompts
      •   Track practice progress
      •   Adapt detachment thresholds per user

Together they complete the Detachment Engine into a live behavioral subsystem inside your SCARDS framework.
