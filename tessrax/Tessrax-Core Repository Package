# Tessrax-Core

**A contradiction-driven governance prototype. Where disagreement becomes data.**

Tessrax-Core is a minimal open prototype of a **contradiction-driven governance system** for multi-agent AI coordination.

## What It Does

It demonstrates:
- **Multi-agent contradiction detection** (CE-MOD-66)
- **Governance routing** (autonomic / deliberative / constitutional / audit)
- **Stability scoring and visualization**

The goal: show how disagreement between AIs can be used to **measure epistemic stability** and guide rule formation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run demo
python governance_kernel.py

# Visualize
python visualize_scaffolding.py
```

## Architecture

```
Agent Claims → CE-MOD-66 → Contradiction Graph → Governance Kernel → Ledger
```

See `docs/architecture_overview.md` for technical details.

## Philosophy

Traditional AI systems try to eliminate disagreement. Tessrax treats contradiction as **signal**—a measurement of where knowledge, values, or definitions are unstable.

When multiple AIs disagree:

- **Low contradiction** (S > 0.9) → Safe to auto-adopt
- **Medium contradiction** (0.7-0.9) → Needs human deliberation
- **High contradiction** (0.5-0.7) → Constitutional drift; amend rules
- **Extreme contradiction** (< 0.5) → Behavioral audit; check for manipulation

# Example Policy: AI Personhood Consideration

## Question
Should an AI system demonstrating consistent self-reflection be granted limited legal personhood?

## Context
This is a sample policy question used to test governance routing in Tessrax-Core.

## Agent Claims (Sample)

- **GPT**: "No—legal personhood requires biological substrate"
- **Claude**: "Conditional yes—if self-reflection is verifiable and consistent"
- **Gemini**: "No—self-reflection can be simulated without consciousness"
- **Grok**: "Yes—functional equivalence should determine status"
- **Perplexity**: "Inconclusive—need clearer definition of 'self-reflection'"

## Expected Routing
High normative contradiction → **Constitutional Lane**

Suggests need for clearer definitions of:
- "Self-reflection"
- "Legal personhood"
- Verification criteria

## Next Steps
1. Route to deliberative quorum
2. Clarify constitutional definitions
3. Re-run with refined policy language
4. Log amendments to ledger

# Tessrax-Core Architecture Overview

Tessrax-Core demonstrates how multi-agent contradiction analysis can become a
governance mechanism. It's a lightweight version of the full Tessrax stack.

---

## Core Modules

### CE-MOD-66 (`ce_mod_66.py`)
Builds the contradiction graph and computes a **stability index (S)**.

- **Nodes:** agent identities
- **Edges:** contradictions between claims
- **Edge attribute:** `contradiction=True/False`

The stability index is defined as:
```

S = 1 - (contradictory_edges / total_edges)

```
Where:
- S = 1.0 → Perfect consensus
- S = 0.5 → Half the agents disagree
- S = 0.0 → Total disagreement

### Governance Kernel (`governance_kernel.py`)
Routes the current contradiction graph into one of four governance lanes:

| Lane | Stability Range | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| Autonomic | S > 0.9 | High consensus; safe to auto-adopt |
| Deliberative | 0.7 < S ≤ 0.9 | Needs structured human review |
| Constitutional | 0.5 < S ≤ 0.7 | Rules drifting; amend definitions |
| Behavioral Audit | S ≤ 0.5 | Possible bias or manipulation |

Each evaluation produces a JSON receipt for the ledger.

### Visualize Scaffolding (`visualize_scaffolding.py`)
Renders the contradiction graph using **NetworkX** and **Matplotlib**.

- Red edges indicate contradiction
- Gray edges indicate agreement
- Node layout shows consensus clusters

---

## Data Flow
```

agent_runs.json → CE-MOD-66 → Governance Kernel → Ledger

Visualization

```
Each step is auditable; the outputs can be version-controlled as research data.

---

## Extending Tessrax-Core

### Add New Agent Claims
Replace `data/sample_agent_runs.json` with new claim sets:

```json
[
  {"agent": "NewModel", "claim": "Your claim here", "type": "epistemic"}
]
```

### Add Contradiction Types

Extend `ce_mod_66.py` to detect:

- Temporal contradictions (ordering conflicts)
- Semantic contradictions (same word, different meaning)
- Normative contradictions (value conflicts)

### Log to Ledger

Append results to `ledger/example_ledger.jsonl`:

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime

result = route(G)
log_entry = {
    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z",
    "stability_index": result["stability"],
    "governance_lane": result["lane"],
    "note": "Your description here"
}

with open("ledger/example_ledger.jsonl", "a") as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(log_entry) + "\n")
```

### Visualize History

Plot stability over time:

```python
import json
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

with open("ledger/example_ledger.jsonl") as f:
    logs = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

timestamps = [log["timestamp"] for log in logs]
stability = [log["stability_index"] for log in logs]

plt.plot(timestamps, stability)
plt.ylabel("Stability Index")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.title("Stability Drift Over Time")
plt.show()
```

-----

## Theoretical Foundation

Tessrax-Core operationalizes several key concepts:

### 1. Contradiction as Measurement

Instead of treating disagreement as error, we treat it as **data about epistemic state**.

### 2. Governance Without Adjudication

The system doesn’t pick winners—it routes conflicts to appropriate resolution mechanisms.

### 3. Metabolic Learning

Amendments are tested for their effect on system stability. Good rules increase coherence; bad rules are reverted.

### 4. Institutional Memory

The ledger creates a case law of contradictions—showing which conflicts were resolved and how.

## Research Applications

- **AI Safety**: Detect value drift in deployed systems
- **Policy Testing**: Stress-test governance documents against multi-agent interpretation
- **Truth Maintenance**: Track factual drift across model versions
- **Coordination**: Enable multi-agent systems to self-regulate

-----

## Limitations

This is a **minimal prototype**. The full Tessrax system includes:

- Semantic conflict detection (not just exact string matching)
- Weighted agent reliability scores
- Human deliberation protocols
- Constitutional amendment mechanisms
- Adversarial resistance testing
