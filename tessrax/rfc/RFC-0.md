# Tessrax RFC-0: Foundational Charter

**Status:** Active  
**Version:** 1.2  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-05  
**Author:** Joshua Vetos (@joshuavetos)  
**Type:** Informational / Governance Root

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes the **foundational principles** of Tessrax — an open research project exploring **auditable AI governance**.  
It defines the system’s purpose, architectural primitives, and the procedural laws that govern its evolution.

Tessrax is both a **technical framework** and a **constitutional experiment**:  
a way to make computational systems **self-verifying, contradiction-aware, and ethically accountable** through explicit governance code.

---

## 2. Background and Motivation

Modern AI systems excel at computation but fail at **transparency and traceability**.  
The inability to show *why* a model or process produced a result erodes both trust and safety.

Tessrax originated from the hypothesis that accountability can be **engineered directly into software**, not added later as policy.  
It does this by making every computation produce a **verifiable receipt** and every decision pass through a **governance pipeline** capable of auditing itself.

---

## 3. Scope

Tessrax defines an **infrastructure of trust** built from modular components:

| Primitive | Responsibility |
|------------|----------------|
| **Receipts** | Cryptographically signed proofs of computation. |
| **Ledger** | Append-only Merkle-linked record of all events. |
| **Memory** | State layer with provenance and contradiction detection. |
| **Sandbox** | Secure execution environment enforcing resource limits. |
| **Quorum & Dissent** | Collective validation and transparent disagreement. |
| **Federation** | Multi-node replication for distributed resilience. |

These primitives form the **Tessrax Governance Stack**, which can be embedded in any AI workflow to guarantee traceability and auditability.

---

## 4. Governance Principles

1. **Transparency is Structural** — Every decision must leave an auditable trail.  
2. **Contradictions Are Signals, Not Failures** — Detection of inconsistency triggers metabolism, not suppression.  
3. **Human Oversight Is Integral** — Automation must remain legible to its operators.  
4. **Receipts > Assertions** — Claims are only valid if backed by cryptographic proof.  
5. **Ledger Is Law** — The append-only ledger is the canonical record of truth.  
6. **Extensibility Through RFCs** — All system changes must be proposed as RFCs referencing this charter.  
7. **Federation Over Centralization** — Trust emerges from redundancy and open verification, not authority.

---

## 5. Architectural Overview
Agent → Human Review → Sandbox → Receipt → Ledger → Quorum → Federation
Each step is verifiable and produces its own signed artifact.  
Together, these form a closed feedback loop of **observation, action, verification, and propagation**.

---

## 6. Compliance and Versioning

- All official modules must embed a `TESSRAX_VERSION` constant.  
- Changes to primitives or governance logic require a new RFC (`RFC-N.md`) referencing this document.  
- The ledger records all accepted RFC hashes for traceability.  
- Backward-incompatible changes increment the major version.

---

## 7. Implementation Notes

The reference implementation is written in **Python 3.11+**, organized under the following namespaces:
tessrax/core/     → primitives (ledger, receipts, sandbox, resource_guard)
tessrax/utils/    → helpers (tracer, key management, reliability harness)
tessrax/pilots/   → experimental dashboards and validation suites
rfc/              → governance documents (this file)
External dependencies:  
`PyNaCl`, `psutil`, `prometheus_client`, and `sqlite3` (standard library).

---

## 8. Future Work

- Expand Federation into a peer-to-peer replication mesh.  
- Add blockchain anchoring for external immutability.  
- Develop a visual “Moral Systems Engineering” dashboard for real-time audit telemetry.  
- Establish interoperability with existing provenance standards (e.g., W3C PROV, OpenLineage).
