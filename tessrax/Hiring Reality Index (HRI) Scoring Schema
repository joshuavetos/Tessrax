# 📦 Tessrax Governance Save — HRI + CDI Integration (v1.0, 2025-10-14)

### 1. **HRI Data Lake v1.0**
**File:** `/data/HRI_Data_Lake_2025.jsonl`  
**Purpose:** Canonical dataset aggregating all sector metrics (2024–2025).  
**Contents:**  
- 12 JSON datasets covering: ghosting, AI screening, transparency, credential inflation, job board integrity, psychological/economic toll, AI bias audits, applicant spending, governance/policy, sector snapshots (Tech, Finance, Healthcare, Education), and visualization datasets.  
**Integrity:** High-confidence, fully sourced, JSONL format ready for ingestion.

---

### 2. **Contradiction Delta Index (CDI) Framework**
**Definition:**  
CDI = (Δ₁ + Δ₂ − Δ₃) / 3  
Where:
- Δ₁ (Human Contact Loss) = 100 − Response Rate Avg  
- Δ₂ (Automation Burden) = AI_Screening_Rate − Human_Review_Rate  
- Δ₃ (Transparency Recovery) = Salary_Transparency − Ghost_Job_Rate  

**Interpretation:**  
- High CDI = entropy dominates (system dehumanized)  
- Low CDI = transparency restores equilibrium  

**Governance Thresholds:**  
| Range | Category | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| 0–30  | Functional | Equilibrium system |
| 31–45 | Marginal | Manageable strain |
| 46–60 | Dysfunctional | Systemic breakdown |
| >60   | Critical | Structural failure |

---

### 3. **Sector CDI Results (2025)**
| Sector | CDI | Status | Primary Contradiction |
|:--|--:|:--|:--|
| Technology | **55.7** | 🔴 Severely Dysfunctional | Automation vs Humanity |
| Finance | **44.8** | 🟠 Marginal | Efficiency vs Empathy |
| Healthcare | **56.3** | 🔴 Severely Dysfunctional | Labor Shortage vs Ethical Duty |
| Education | **36.8** | 🟡 Moderately Functional | Resource Scarcity vs Moral Consistency |

**Insight:** Education sector demonstrates that a humane equilibrium (CDI < 40) is possible under high transparency and moderate automation.

---

### 4. **Contradiction Geometry (Cross-Sector Differentials)**
**Tech vs Education Δ:**
- Ghosting: +9 pts (Tech worse)
- AI Screening: +20 pts (Tech worse)
- Transparency: −2.2 pts (Education better)
- **Net Contradiction Delta: +31.2 pts**
→ Education is **31 points healthier** than Tech.

**Interpretation:**  
Education sustains low entropy due to stronger human contact and better transparency compliance.

### 5. **Governance Pipeline**
**Ingestion Pathway:**

HRI_Data_Lake_2025.jsonl
↓
CE-MOD-66 (Contradiction Engine)
↓
Governance Kernel → Ledger.txt (audit)
↓
Dashboard (live CDI visualization)

**Visualization:**
- Red (CDI > 60) = Critical Dysfunction
- Amber (46–60) = Dysfunctional
- Yellow (31–45) = Marginal
- Green (0–30) = Functional  

Run command:
```bash
python current.py --module HRI

→ launches Flask dashboard on port 8090.

6. Regulatory & Business Applications

Regulatory Evidence:
Use CDI data for EEOC/FTC filings showing quantifiable hiring harm.

Certification Program:
“CDI 30 Certified Employer” — badge for companies achieving CDI < 30 via verified audits.

Public API (planned):

GET /api/cdi/{sector}
→ {"sector": "Technology", "CDI": 55.7, "status": "Dysfunctional"}

Business Model:
Audits ($5K–$15K), certification, API access, public dashboard.

7. Thermodynamic Interpretation
   •   Ghosting = communication entropy
   •   Automation = mechanization bias (energy loss from human agency)
   •   Transparency = restorative counterforce (negentropy)
CDI acts as a thermodynamic measure of labor dignity — quantifying how efficiently a labor market preserves human equilibrium.

8. Next Research Phases
	1.	CDI Trends (2023→2025): Track historical entropy evolution.
	2.	Company-Level CDI: Extend dataset to include top 100 employers.
	3.	Contradiction Matrix:

Tech  Finance  Healthcare  Education
Tech      -     +10.9    -0.6        +18.9
Finance  -10.9   -       -11.5       +8.0
Healthcare +0.6 +11.5     -          +19.5
Education -18.9 -8.0     -19.5        -

→ Positive = healthier sector.

10. Summary Insight

“Every digital efficiency subtracts empathy faster than transparency reforms can restore it.
The Hiring Reality Index (HRI) quantifies dysfunction; the Contradiction Delta Index (CDI) reveals its entropy path.
Together they measure whether modern labor systems are humane or mechanized.”
