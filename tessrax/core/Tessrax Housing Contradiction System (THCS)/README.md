# Tessrax Housing Prototype 🏠  
*Metabolizing the contradiction between financial velocity and material durability*

---

## Overview

The Tessrax Housing Prototype is a working **domain-level proof** of the Tessrax Stack—the governance architecture that treats contradictions as data rather than errors.  
It demonstrates how Tessrax can detect, log, visualize, and govern a real-world contradiction inside a single economic system: **American housing**.

**Core contradiction:**
> Profitable housing requires high transaction velocity  
> Durable housing requires low transaction velocity

In other words: finance rewards churn, while the physical world rewards endurance.  
This subsystem turns that tension into measurable, governable data.

## How It Works

The prototype implements the **full Tessrax cycle**:

| Phase | Module | Function |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **1. Detection** | `housing_contradiction_detector.py` | Ingest housing data (age, refinance rate, material lifespan). Compute contradiction score between churn and durability. |
| **2. Logging** | `housing_contradiction_ledger.json` | Append detected tensions as immutable receipts. |
| **3. Metabolism** | `housing_primitives.py` | Quantify new governance mechanisms: durability yield, insurance inversion, transaction cost visibility, and material provenance value. |
| **4. Visualization** | `housing_contradiction_graph.py` | Render contradiction landscape as a 2D graph of velocity vs. durability. |
| **5. Governance** | `housing_governance_kernel.py` | Enable proposals, quorum voting, and dissent logging for new primitives. |

All components interoperate with the **core Tessrax primitives**:
`ledger.py`, `receipts.py`, `quorum.py`, and `dissent.py`.

## Running the Prototype

Clone and open the main Tessrax repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshuavetos/Tessrax
cd Tessrax/housing

1. Detect Contradictions

python housing_contradiction_detector.py

Outputs JSON receipts of measurable tensions between financial churn and material endurance.

2. Visualize

python housing_contradiction_graph.py

Displays an interactive scatter plot:
   •   X-axis: Transaction velocity (refinances per decade)
   •   Y-axis: Durability index (0–1)
   •   Color: Contradiction score intensity

3. Metabolize

python housing_primitives.py

Calculates experimental governance metrics:
   •   durability_yield() → ROI on longevity
   •   insurance_inversion() → premium reductions for endurance
   •   transaction_cost_visibility() → hidden churn costs
   •   material_provenance_value() → market value of verified lifespan

4. Govern

python housing_governance_kernel.py

Demonstrates proposal, quorum voting, and dissent logging using the global Tessrax ledger.

Why It Matters
   •   Transparency: Converts invisible economic distortions into visible contradictions.
   •   Accountability: Uses receipts and Merkle-root verification to track policy proposals.
   •   Adaptability: Shows how the same governance architecture used for AI alignment can apply to urban economics, insurance, and sustainability.
   •   Philosophy in motion: Tessrax doesn’t erase tension—it metabolizes it into structure.

Extending the Model

The housing prototype is a template for other contradiction domains:

Domain	Core Tension
AI Systems	Coherence vs. Contradiction-Awareness
Attention Economy	Engagement Maximization vs. Cognitive Health
Democratic Governance	Efficiency vs. Representation
Climate Policy	Growth Incentives vs. Resource Preservation

Each can follow the same five-stage pattern: detect → log → metabolize → visualize → govern.

Philosophy

“Contradiction isn’t failure—it’s metabolism.”

This prototype turns that sentence into code.
It’s a small but complete world where housing data becomes governance fuel—
a visible proof that the Tessrax Stack can learn from tension instead of hiding it.
