# Tessrax_Rigor_Layer_v1.0  
**Purpose:**  
Integrates six governance modules ensuring coherent difference management, telos integrity, interpretive charity, observer neutrality, invariant preservation, and scale reconciliation.  
This layer completes the structural “Integrity Band” between the Metabolism and Governance engines, as recommended by external audits (Gemini, Copilot, Perplexity).

Integration

Directory: /core/rigor/
Shared Interfaces:
   •   contradiction_engine.py — contradiction routing.
   •   governance_kernel.py — telos registry and escalation.
   •   metabolism_adapter.py — entropy metrics and difference gradients.
   •   ledger.py — immutable event logging and hash linking.

Purpose Summary:
This Rigor Layer enforces structured differentiation, telos coherence, interpretive humility, observer neutrality, lawful constraint preservation, and multi-scale reconciliation.
It stabilizes the Tessrax Stack’s internal contradictions without dulling its capacity for adaptation—forming the bridge between raw perception and governed decision.
