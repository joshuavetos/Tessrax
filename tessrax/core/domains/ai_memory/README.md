# Tessrax AI Memory Prototype 🧠  
*Metabolizing the contradiction between coherence and contradiction retention.*

---

## Overview
This domain demonstrates how Tessrax governs **epistemic contradictions** inside AI systems.  
Where traditional models overwrite inconsistencies, Tessrax logs and governs them.

**Core contradiction:**  
> "AI systems maximize coherence"  
> "Knowledge growth requires contradiction retention"

## System Flow

| Phase | Module | Function |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **1. Detection** | `memory_contradiction_detector.py` | Detect overwritten memory entries and score their contradictions. |
| **2. Logging** | `ledger.py` | Store contradiction receipts in the global governance ledger. |
| **3. Metabolism** | `memory_primitives.py` | Quantify conflict density, coherence penalty, and provenance retention yield. |
| **4. Visualization** | `memory_contradiction_graph.py` | Display coherence vs. conflict density. |
| **5. Governance** | `memory_governance_kernel.py` | Propose, vote, and record dissent on retention policies. |

## Running the Prototype

```bash
cd domains/ai_memory
python memory_contradiction_detector.py      # Detect conflicts
python memory_contradiction_graph.py         # Visualize coherence vs. conflict
python memory_primitives.py                  # Inspect metabolic metrics
python memory_governance_kernel.py           # Run governance cycle
What It Proves
   •   Contradiction as signal: information conflicts become data, not errors.
   •   Auditable learning: each overwrite carries a receipt and provenance hash.
   •   Governable memory: retention rules decided through quorum + dissent logic.

⸻

Extension Ideas
   •   Integrate with model checkpoints to detect training-drift contradictions.
   •   Map conflict clusters over time for long-term epistemic health tracking.
   •   Generalize to any system where “forgetting” hides accountability.

“Memory without contradiction is propaganda.”
