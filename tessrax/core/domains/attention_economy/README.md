# Tessrax Attention Economy Prototype 🔦  
*Metabolizing the contradiction between engagement and well-being.*

---

## Overview
The Attention Economy domain applies Tessrax’s governance model to behavioral systems that trade human focus for profit.  
It detects, logs, and governs the tension between **engagement time** and **mental health**.

**Core contradiction:**  
> “Platforms maximize engagement time.”  
> “Users maximize well-being and focus.”

## System Flow

| Phase | Module | Function |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **1. Detection** | `attention_contradiction_detector.py` | Ingest session data and well-being scores; output contradiction receipts. |
| **2. Logging** | `ledger.py` | Append results to global Tessrax ledger. |
| **3. Metabolism** | `attention_primitives.py` | Quantify focus yield, dopamine dividend, feed entropy, and ad revenue inversion. |
| **4. Visualization** | `attention_contradiction_graph.py` | Plot session length vs. well-being. |
| **5. Governance** | `attention_governance_kernel.py` | Run proposals, quorum votes, and dissent logging for new focus policies. |

## Running the Prototype

```bash
cd domains/attention_economy
python attention_contradiction_detector.py     # Detect contradictions
python attention_contradiction_graph.py        # Visualize engagement vs. well-being
python attention_primitives.py                 # Inspect metabolic metrics
python attention_governance_kernel.py          # Simulate governance vote
What It Proves
   •   Visible trade-offs: quantifies attention extraction vs. cognitive health.
   •   Governable design: converts ethics debates into ledgered policy experiments.
   •   Cross-domain validity: same primitives that govern AI memory or housing can govern behavioral markets.

⸻

Extension Ideas
   •   Integrate with open social-media APIs for real metrics.
   •   Link with insurance or health-economics datasets to price attention recovery.
   •   Create “Focus Bonds” — instruments paying dividends for reduced screen-time churn.

“When every click is currency, attention itself becomes debt.
Tessrax teaches the system to account for its own distraction.”
