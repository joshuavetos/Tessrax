# Tessrax Climate Policy Prototype 🌍
*Metabolizing the contradiction between growth and preservation.*

## Overview
This domain operationalizes the Tessrax Stack for environmental governance: logging measurable contradictions between GDP growth and emissions outcomes.

**Core contradiction:**  
> Economic systems seek expansion; ecological systems demand limits.

## Run
```bash
cd domains/climate_policy
python climate_contradiction_detector.py
python climate_contradiction_graph.py
python climate_primitives.py
python climate_governance_kernel.py
Insights
   •   Visible tension: quantifies growth vs. sustainability.
   •   Governable trade-offs: policies evaluated via quorum and dissent.
   •   Cross-domain resonance: same metabolism engine that manages AI memory or attention now governs planetary inputs and outputs.

“Growth without limits is entropy; Tessrax writes the receipt.”
