Artifact: Tessrax Strategic Roadmap Audit Directive (Codex Input)
Verdict: FAIL
Executive Summary â€¦
The roadmap enumerates aspirational governance milestones but omits any ledger-backed proof of completion. Runtime verification is referenced abstractly without execution logs, and the listed deliverables recycle boilerplate from prior phases without addressing the contradiction backlog uncovered in v12.

Key Findings
- Milestone alignment: 0/5 milestones shipped with a verifiable receipt ID or CI transcript. Without receipts, no falsifiable evidence exists for claimed deployments.
- Risk posture: Governance kernel upgrades cite "semantic routing online" while `sentence-transformers` remained absent from the dependency lock prior to this remediation, contradicting operational readiness claims.
- Validation debt: Streamlit dashboards were said to be "resilient to outages" yet crashed on the first HTTP error, disproving the resilience narrative within five requests.
- Audit coverage: Multi-agent stress testing was promised but only placeholder printouts existed; no contradiction graphs or semantic overlap scores were archived.

Recommended Remediation
- Treat milestone acceptance as contingent on hashed receipts captured in `ledger/receipts` and reproduce the hashes inside the roadmap narrative.
- Bundle CI evidence with every governance claim by referencing `tests/logs/ci_runs.log` (generated via `python tests/verify_ci.py`).
- Attach multi-agent evaluation traces from `tests/logs/multi_agent_consistency.log` to demonstrate semantic stability rather than anecdotal summaries.
