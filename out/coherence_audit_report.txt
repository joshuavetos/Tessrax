Tessrax Coherence Repair â€“ Audit Summary
========================================

Fixed Imports
-------------
- Added package initialisers for `tessrax_truth_api.engine`, `.middleware`, and `.services` so relative imports resolve consistently during packaging and tests.
- Converted the non-Python documentation artefact `tessrax/docs/unified_test_bundle.py` into a Markdown document to prevent syntax errors during module discovery.

Dependency Changes
------------------
- Declared the full runtime dependency set inside `pyproject.toml`/`setup.cfg`, aligned with Python 3.11 support (`python_requires = ">=3.10,<3.12"`).
- Promoted runtime pins for FastAPI, Starlette, Redis, Celery, Streamlit, pandas, matplotlib, plotly, etc., and introduced a light-weight `[ml]` extra for optional `sentence-transformers` usage.
- Updated `requirements.txt` to mirror the packaging metadata, add explicit versions, and call out the ML extra for optional installation.

Added Files
-----------
- `setup.cfg` with unified packaging metadata.
- `tessrax_truth_api/engine/__init__.py`
- `tessrax_truth_api/middleware/__init__.py`
- `tessrax_truth_api/services/__init__.py`
- `tessrax/docs/unified_test_bundle.md`

CI / Workflow Notes
-------------------
- Existing GitHub Actions already target Python 3.11 and install dependencies before running tests; no YAML changes were required.

Validation
----------
- Created a dedicated Python 3.11 virtual environment with `uv` and verified `pip install -e .` plus `pip install -e .[dev]` complete successfully.
- Pytest suite passes in the Python 3.11 environment: `pytest -q` (39 passed).
