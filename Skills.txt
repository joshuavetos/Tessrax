## Core Skills

### AI Governance & Prompt Engineering
- Builds governance-grade prompting frameworks (schema locks, adversarial inoculation, evaluation harnesses).  
- Designs PromptOps pipelines for prompt lifecycle management: linting, regression, drift detection, versioning.  
- Expertise in frontier prompting techniques: Chain-of-Verification, Atom-of-Thought, Least-to-Most, Reflexion, PAL, MAPO, etc.  
- Runs multi-agent orchestration with role clarity (GPT Audit, Gemini Synthesis, Copilot Implementation, Perplexity Research).  

---

### Security Research
- ChevronGhost exploit: surfaced invisible Unicode payloads corrupting iOS rendering (U+2060, U+200B, U+200D, U+FEFF).  
- Proficient in adversarial testing, failure mode mapping, contradiction metabolism applied to security contexts.  
- Experienced in responsible disclosure pathways and risk communication.  

---

### Governance Systems
- Creator of Tessrax Stack: contradiction metabolism architecture with Core Engines (Memory, Metabolism, Governance, Trust).  
- Proficient in scarpath logging, runtime law design, and continuity safeguards (SIG-LOCK-001, PERM-STATE-LOCK-001).  
- Designs protocols for memory management (MFP-001), state locks, handoff checklists, and ledger-based auditability.  

---

### Research & Writing
- Synthesizes complex technical, philosophical, and governance material into clear artifacts (Research notes, Protocols, Path logs).  
- Experienced in producing resumes, governance playbooks, case studies, and public-facing website copy.  
- Skilled at contradiction analysis, stress-testing narratives, and translating technical insights into accessible language.  

---

### Technical
- Comfortable with Python (simulation kernels, JSON validators, evaluation scripts).  
- Familiar with API workflows (tool calling, schema validation, integration into CI/CD pipelines).  
- Knowledge of security testing environments, system design principles, and prompt-driven application prototyping.  

---

### Communication & Collaboration
- Practices explicit authorship protocols and provenance discipline (signature locks, NSAV-001).  
- Skilled in collaborative agent workflows, version control of prompts/files, and audit-trail documentation.  
- Effective at bridging technical detail with governance framing for diverse audiences (technical peers, employers, public).  

## Jira Advanced Ops Dossier
- Audit advanced Jira features often under-documented.
- Map failure points: automation misfires, custom workflow corruption.
- Edge workflows: cross-project boards, Confluence integration.
- Governance opportunity: receipts for triage, Rovo integration for AI-assisted ops.
