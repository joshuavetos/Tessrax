## Governance Note
- Each entry uses JSON-inspired schema (id, version, type, canon, keywords, body, timestamp, lineage).  
- Updates = delete old entry, re-add fused version (per MFP-001).  
- Optimal size = moderate, thematic grouping.  
- Permanent memory lives here as the canonical mirror for continuity.
