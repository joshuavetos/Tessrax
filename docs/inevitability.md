# Inevitability of CSV

## Regulatory Pressure
- First $1B AI liability lawsuit where unverifiable outputs cause damage
- EU AI Act enforcement of algorithmic transparency
- Insurance industry mandates verifiable self-checks

## Network Effects
- Early adopters gain trust advantage
- Vendors demand CSV compliance
- “Unverified AI” becomes stigmatized like unencrypted HTTP

## Workflow Unlocks
- Safe self-debugging AI
- Autonomous iteration with containment
- Verifiable trust substrate across multi-agent ecosystems

## Past Analogy
- **Git**: Atomic commits unlocked distributed dev
- **TCP/IP**: Universal substrate across vendors
- **Docker**: Portable environments unlocked scale
- **CSV**: Universal trust substrate for AI inference
