# Tessrax Repository Redundancy & Coherence Audit (v1.1)

This report captures the refreshed outputs of the automated redundancy and coherence audit executed via the `AGENTS` Codex flow.

## Overview

- **Total files scanned:** 154
- **Duplicate file hashes identified:** 0
- **Function names reused across modules:** 14

Detailed machine-readable results are stored in [`reports/redundancy_audit`](../reports/redundancy_audit).

## Key Findings

1. **Duplicate files resolved** – Previously duplicated placeholder packages and build artefacts were consolidated or removed, and no duplicate hashes remain in the repository. See the updated [`duplicate_files.json`](../reports/redundancy_audit/duplicate_files.json) for verification.
2. **Redundant function names** – Multiple modules still implement functions with the same name, including `route_to_governance_lane`, `_build_cli`, and `main`. These overlaps may indicate shared interfaces or potential refactoring targets. Refer to [`redundant_functions.json`](../reports/redundancy_audit/redundant_functions.json).
3. **Repository snapshot** – The full file inventory, function/class map, and audit summary are available under [`reports/redundancy_audit`](../reports/redundancy_audit).

## Recommendations

- Continue monitoring for regenerated build artefacts (for example `*.egg-info/`) or placeholder package markers that can safely be excluded from version control.
- Evaluate modules with repeated function names to confirm intentional reuse versus redundant implementations.
- Periodically archive stale documentation files or placeholders to keep the repository lean.
